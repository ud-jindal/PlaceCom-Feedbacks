This</p>\r\n<p>may be very atypical compared to the experiences of my peers, who have been a part of</p>\r\n<p>multiple tests/interviews. I recommend sampling from a larger set.</p>\r\n<p>I participated in the placement process for Amazon, which was the first company that visited</p>\r\n<p>IIITB for our batch. I was offered both an internship and full-time employment. I accepted</p>\r\n<p>only the full-time employment offer, as I had planned to do a thesis under Prof. Murali. (I</p>\r\n<p>had applied only for FTE, yet I was offered both; the HR manager said that Amazon has</p>\r\n<p>a policy of offering an internship to any students they hire for FTE. She also said students</p>\r\n<p>hired as interns only have a very high (~95%) rate of conversion into full-time employees.)</p>\r\n<p>1 Written Round</p>\r\n<p>The &ldquo;written&rdquo; round was on the HackerRank platform, consisting of 20 MCQs and 2 programs,</p>\r\n<p>to be completed in 90 minutes. The relative weightage for the two sections was not</p>\r\n<p>disclosed. Time was short. I generally do not have problems completing my exams in time.</p>\r\n<p>So I did not anticipate this problem. It was however; and I was not able to attempt the</p>\r\n<p>second programming question only for the lack of time. I also attempted the MCQ section</p>\r\n<p>first and spent more time on it than I should have.</p>\r\n<p>MCQ section</p>\r\n<p>There were 20 MCQs. There was some confusion about whether there were negative marks</p>\r\n<p>for wrong answers or not. Eventually, it was confirmed that negative marking was there for</p>\r\n<p>incorrect answers. Again, the exact marks for getting an answer right or wrong were not</p>\r\n<p>disclosed. I felt the questions were mostly easy, however they were lengthy. Most questions</p>\r\n<p>were something that you would see in a typical GATE paper. There was a lot of emphasis</p>\r\n<p>on OS related questions, especially Inter-Process Communication. There were also 3 easy</p>\r\n<p>questions on page faults, at least 3 on process scheduling and 1 question about a 3 level</p>\r\n<p>page table and virtual memory. As far as I recall, there were no questions on Databases or</p>\r\n<p>Networks. There was one simple question on probability and another simple logic question.</p>\r\n<p>There were two questions where the output of a given code snippet had to be evaluated. The</p>\r\n<p>remaining questions were from DSA (basic binary trees, sorting, stacks/queues, hashing with</p>\r\n<p>linear probing). To reiterate, the questions were quite simple but lengthy. Most solutions</p>\r\n<p>needed to be worked out on paper (average waiting time for Round Robin scheduling, number</p>\r\n<p>of page faults for a given sequence of requests, etc.) Refer to Appendix A on page 5 for</p>\r\n<p>the actual questions, as I remember them.</p>\r\n<p>Programming Section</p>\r\n<p>Program 1</p>\r\n<p>The input is 1 line containing space separated strings. (The number of strings is not explicitly</p>\r\n<p>given.) The expected output is to print all strings which are anagrams of each other on the</p>\r\n<p>same line. For eg.:</p>\r\n<p>Input: act lint god cat dog tac</p>\r\n<p>Output: act cat tac</p>\r\n<p>lint</p>\r\n<p>god dog</p>\r\n<p>Program 2</p>\r\n<p>The input is a m &times; n matrix with each cell having containing 0 or 1. Two cells belong to</p>\r\n<p>the same region if they both contain 1 and are neighbours. (Here the neighbourhood of a</p>\r\n<p>cell is defined as the set of 8 cells surrounding it.) The expected output is the size of the</p>\r\n<p>largest region. I attempted this program. A simple recursive traversal of the matrix, keeping</p>\r\n<p>track of the cells which have been visited and the maximum size is enough. My solution was</p>\r\n<p>O(mn) in both time and space.</p>\r\n<p>2 Interview Rounds</p>\r\n<p>Amazon had 4 rounds of interviews, all technical. There was no HR round/screening, though</p>\r\n<p>we did interact with the people from HR in between the other rounds. All questions were on</p>\r\n<p>Data Structures and Algorithms. There were no questions on Operating Systems, Databases</p>\r\n<p>and Networks. I did get one brief question on using Git. The interviews were not designed</p>\r\n<p>to get progressively tougher. Candidates did not get eliminated after every round; some</p>\r\n<p>candidates also had their third interview round before others had had their second round.</p>\r\n<p>Each interviewer had mostly a fixed set of questions, which they asked every candidate.</p>\r\n<p>Each candidate got a different interviewer every round. Thus, my first round could have</p>\r\n<p>been very similar to someone else&rsquo;s fourth round, or vice versa. The interviews were also</p>\r\n<p>fairly simple and I was able to answer every question. The interviewers do go through your</p>\r\n<p>resume, though they do not ask too many questions based off your projects.</p>\r\n<p>Amazon did not have stress rounds or rude interviewers like some of the companies that</p>\r\n<p>visited later. The interviewers were very friendly; they did not try to hurry interviewees or</p>\r\n<p>force us to make mistakes, and were generally helpful with hints.</p>\r\n<p>Round 1</p>\r\n<p>I was asked to introduce myself and then speak about any one of my projects. I felt that this</p>\r\n<p>was more of an ice breaker, as the interviewer decided to move on just as I started explaining</p>\r\n<p>the most interesting part of my project. The main focus of the interview were the first two</p>\r\n<p>questions below, followed by a quick question on Git.</p>\r\n<p>1. I was asked to solve the problem described http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimumnumber-</p>\r\n<p>of-jumps-to-reach-end-of-a-given-array/ and then write the code for</p>\r\n<p>the solution on paper. The interviewer went through my code to check it and asked</p>\r\n<p>my to trace the output for a few test cases.</p>\r\n<p>2. Given an infinite number line, and a destination, what is the minimum number of turns</p>\r\n<p>you can can reach the destination starting from 0? Here, on the ith turn, you can move</p>\r\n<p>either &plusmn;i steps from your current location. Since we didn&rsquo;t have too much time, I was</p>\r\n<p>asked to just present a solution approach and not write code.</p>\r\n<p>3. What are the commands used when you want to commit new changes to Git? The</p>\r\n<p>answer expected was add, commit and push.</p>\r\n<p>The interviewer then asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked for a few details about</p>\r\n<p>his work and the average number hours he worked each day. This was something I asked all</p>\r\n<p>the interviewers.</p>\r\n<p>Round 2</p>\r\n<p>In this interview I was asked to code the solution for the problem here: http://www.</p>\r\n<p>geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-path-sum-two-leaves-binary-tree/. I also had to</p>\r\n<p>explain my code and convince the interviewer that it was right.</p>\r\n<p>Round 3</p>\r\n<p>This was the easiest round for me. I had to answer two questions.</p>\r\n<p>1. Given a set of ropes, each of certain length l, find the cheapest way of tying them all</p>\r\n<p>together. The cost of tying two ropes of lengths l1 and l2 is defined as the sum of</p>\r\n<p>their lengths, i.e. l1 + l2. The simple greedy approach of tying the two shortest pieces</p>\r\n<p>of rope at any point of time works here. I was asked to write pesudocode for this</p>\r\n<p>solution. The interviewer wanted to basically check if I could recognise this property</p>\r\n<p>and identify that a min heap was to be used.</p>\r\n<p>2. Given n, how many n bit binary strings exist which do not have 2 consecutive ones?</p>\r\n<p>The answer can be easily computed as 2n &minus; an, where an is the number of n bit</p>\r\n<p>numbers which have at least 2 consecutive ones. The recursion for calculating an is</p>\r\n<p>pretty simple, it works out to the Fibonacci sequence. I was asked to write the full</p>\r\n<p>code for this solution.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Round 4</p>\r\n<p>I was again asked two questions in the last round, both on strings. The first question was</p>\r\n<p>meant to be easy, a sort of warm up.</p>\r\n<p>1. Given a string, say &ldquo;aaabbccc&rdquo;, it is transformed to &ldquo;a3b2c3&rdquo;. The string &ldquo;abcd&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>will be transformed into &ldquo;a1b1c1d1&rdquo;. Note that the transformation defined does not</p>\r\n<p>necessarily guarantee a compression. The task is to transform any given string, in</p>\r\n<p>O(n) time, with a single traversal and using no extra space. Assume that the string (a</p>\r\n<p>string here was to be treated as a C style character array) has already enough memory</p>\r\n<p>allocated to hold the result of the transformation.</p>\r\n<p>2. Given a string, find the longest substring that occurs more than once in the string. For</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;banana&rdquo;, the answer is &ldquo;ana&rdquo;. The na&iuml;ve way is to find all substrings of the string in</p>\r\n<p>decreasing order of their lengths and check if the substring repeats in the rest of the</p>\r\n<p>string. A more optimal solution would be to use something like the rolling hash used</p>\r\n<p>in the Rabin-Karp string matching algorithm or use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string</p>\r\n<p>matching technique to efficiently do substring matching. The first method has the</p>\r\n<p>same expected time complexity as the second method, though the worst case is larger</p>\r\n<p>by a factor of O(n). The first method requires O(1) space, whereas the second method</p>\r\n<p>needs O(n) space. The interviewer did not expect any fixed answer for this question</p>\r\n<p>nor did he have an optimal solution. He did however suggest using a Trie tree based</p>\r\n<p>approach. I felt that my method would work out better and so I rejected the Trie tree</p>\r\n<p>approach.</p>\r\n<p>General Advice</p>\r\n<p>I think having prepared for GATE is more than enough for the MCQ section of the written</p>\r\n<p>round. Just revise whatever concepts you need to. For the interview rounds, I think spending</p>\r\n<p>~3 hours each day on GeeksForGeeks for half a week or so should be enough, at least</p>\r\n<p>for Amazon. I have no particular advice on preparing for coding rounds. However, do</p>\r\n<p>remember, this section generally has the highest weightage across most companies. Being</p>\r\n<p>good at interviews or knowing advanced subjects and concepts from Data Analytics/Machine</p>\r\n<p>Learning will not help you if you do not make it to the interview round.</p>\r\n<p>PS: For the record, from personal experience, I advise against consuming Kahl&uacute;a before</p>\r\n<p>the interview. And especially before the written round. This holds for J&auml;germeister as well.</p>\r\n<p>Best of luck!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Appendix A: MCQs</p>\r\n<p>Listed below are some of the questions from the MCQ round as I remember them.</p>\r\n<p>1. The pre-order traversal of a Binary Search Tree is a1, a2 . . . an. What is the post-order</p>\r\n<p>traversal of the same tree? (The actual values of ai were given.)</p>\r\n<p>2. Calculate the number of page faults, given an initially empty page table of size 4, and</p>\r\n<p>200 requests of the form 1, 2, 3 . . . 100, 100, 99, 98, . . . 1. (There are 100 unique pages</p>\r\n<p>numbered accordingly.) Assume a FIFO replacement policy.</p>\r\n<p>3. Calculate the number of page faults if a cache size of 3 and the LRU replacement policy</p>\r\n<p>is used for the given stream of requests.</p>\r\n<p>4. There are 3 processes P1, P2, P3 each with an arrival time and a total time. What order</p>\r\n<p>will the processes finish if</p>\r\n<p>(a) FCFS scheduling is used?</p>\r\n<p>(b) RR with time quantum of 2 units is used?</p>\r\n<p>5. Calculate the average turnaround time if three processes are scheduled using Round</p>\r\n<p>Robin scheduling with time quantum of 2 units.</p>\r\n<p>6. Calculate the average waiting time if three processes are scheduled using preemptive</p>\r\n<p>Shortest Process Next scheduling.</p>\r\n<p>7. A question on a 3 level page table. I did not bother solving this, so I do not remember</p>\r\n<p>it.</p>\r\n<p>8. Let the probability of of passing in Maths, Physics and Chemistry be m, p, c respectively.</p>\r\n<p>The probability of passing exactly one subject, exactly two subjects and at least</p>\r\n<p>two subjects are given.

Please don&rsquo;t take any question personally and waste too much time on it. No</p>\r\n<p>one cares if you solved 1 question that no one else could do.</p>\r\n<p>2. Don&rsquo;t worry too much about the questions related to basic electronics. I think</p>\r\n<p>they constitute about 4-5 questions in the paper.

Towards the end (last 15-20 mins) if you feel you haven&rsquo;t answered enough</p>\r\n<p>questions, it might be a good idea to leave quant and go for theoretical kind of</p>\r\n<p>questions.

If</p>\r\n<p>you can&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re just normal.</p>\r\n<p>Interviews:</p>\r\n<p>Round 1 (Technical):</p>\r\n<p>The panel consisted of three members. One tests your skills in Java, one in data</p>\r\n<p>sciences and the last person: just asks random general question ( difficulties faced in</p>\r\n<p>any project, etc. )</p>\r\n<p>Most of my interview was on basic concepts of data sciences. I mentioned both R</p>\r\n<p>and Python on my resume. So she asked me what my preference was and I picked</p>\r\n<p>Python. Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. What is a data frame?</p>\r\n<p>2. What is a set?</p>\r\n<p>3. What is a tuple?</p>\r\n<p>Next she asked me to explain one of my projects. The second I talked about using a</p>\r\n<p>Naive Bayes Classifier she stopped me. Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. What is a Naive Bayes Classifier?</p>\r\n<p>2. Write down the formula.</p>\r\n<p>3. A patient takes a lab test and the result comes back positive. It is known that</p>\r\n<p>the test returns a correct positive result in only 99% of the cases and a correct</p>\r\n<p>negative result in only 95% of the cases. Furthermore, only 0.03 of the entire</p>\r\n<p>population has this disease. (Or a similar question)</p>\r\n<p>Can this be solved using Naive Bayes? What is the evidence provided, etc.</p>\r\n<p>4. Question on Probability: There is a parking lot that is empty with a probability</p>\r\n<p>p. For 20 days I observed that it was empty every day. On the 30th day, I</p>\r\n<p>come back. What is the probability that it is empty? (Or something like</p>\r\n<p>that...sorry, can&rsquo;t remember the exact question)</p>\r\n<p>5. What is market basket analysis?</p>\r\n<p>6. How do you prune the candidates? (Ans: using apriori principle)</p>\r\n<p>7. What is apriori principle?</p>\r\n<p>8. Can you make it even better? (I couldn&rsquo;t remember any possible way, so I just</p>\r\n<p>said I can&rsquo;t come up with any idea)</p>\r\n<p>9. What are Markov Chains? (I just said I learnt about them but wasn&rsquo;t able to</p>\r\n<p>recollect)</p>\r\n<p>10.What are the other concepts you learnt in your courses in Data Sciences?</p>\r\n<p>11.Name some standard classification techniques.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the Java expert was asked to interview me.</p>\r\n<p>1. What are exceptions in java?</p>\r\n<p>2. Name some standard exceptions you come across in Java?</p>\r\n<p>3. What is out of memory exception?</p>\r\n<p>4. How do you address or get rid of the out of memory exception?</p>\r\n<p>5. May be 1-2 more basic questions related to Java (I&rsquo;m unable to recollect right</p>\r\n<p>now)</p>\r\n<p>Finally the third guy:</p>\r\n<p>1. Talk about any project in which you had a lot of difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>2. What were these difficulties and how did you deal with them?</p>\r\n<p>3. Given a choice would you prefer a job as a Java developer or as a data</p>\r\n<p>scientist?</p>\r\n<p>Finally. Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>Round 2 (Managerial):</p>\r\n<p>This was a different person. None from the earlier three. He was constantly flipping</p>\r\n<p>through my resume.</p>\r\n<p>Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. What all programming languages did you learn?</p>\r\n<p>2. Explain one of your projects.</p>\r\n<p>3. Why cisco?</p>\r\n<p>4. How many years are you planning on staying in India?</p>\r\n<p>5. If given an offer, for how long will you work at Cisco?</p>\r\n<p>6. A couple of other questions related to previous internships, etc mentioned in</p>\r\n<p>my resume.</p>\r\n<p>7. Finally, do you have any question to ask?</p>\r\n<p>He briefly talked about the kind of work the team he heads does and the kind of work</p>\r\n<p>I would be doing if I were to be offered the internship/job.</p>\r\n<p>Round 3 (HR):</p>\r\n<p>Very short round.</p>\r\n<p>Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Why Cisco?</p>\r\n<p>2. Why integrated MTech?</p>\r\n<p>3. Would you prefer to work in Pune or Blore?</p>\r\n<p>Finally, Thank You!</p>\r\n<p>Tips:</p>\r\n<p>1. The interviewers let you decide how the interview goes ( my interviewer</p>\r\n<p>waited until I mentioned Naive Bayes Classifier before she started asking any</p>\r\n<p>serious questions). Use this to your advantage. Push them towards topics are</p>\r\n<p>are your strong point or those you have confidence in.</p>\r\n<p>2. Go to the interview looking confident and greet each one of them with a</p>\r\n<p>courteous smile as soon as you enter the room. These things may sound silly,</p>\r\n<p>but they actually do matter!</p>\r\n<p>3. Be confident and sure of whatever you say!</p>\r\n<p>4. If you don&rsquo;t know something, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to say so. They prefer you</p>\r\n<p>being honest than trying to bluff your way out.</p>\r\n<p>5. If you have taken the Data Analytics course, well and good. Otherwise take</p>\r\n<p>the slides from someone and just skim through them before going for your</p>\r\n<p>interview (for IT Engineer). Most of the questions were basic stuff and almost</p>\r\n<p>every answer I gave, was from what I learnt from RC sir&rsquo;s slides!</p>\r\n<p>6. Even if you falter in any one question, don&rsquo;t worry, just move on! They don&rsquo;t</p>\r\n<p>expect you to know everything.</p>\r\n<p>7. For questions such as &ldquo;Why Cisco?&rdquo; etc, there is no one right answer. So, try</p>\r\n<p>to give a genuine sounding answer rather than making it sound like something</p>\r\n<p>mugged up.</p>\r\n<p>Hope you find something useful in this four page long essay!</p>\r\n<p>All the very best! :)</p>\r\n<p>- Haripriya</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-03-26 10:53:16','2017-03-26 10:53:16','Haripriya','Mtech it','NA','NA'),(8,'NA','NA@iiitb.org',2014,'<p>Round 1: (MCQs)</p>\r\n<p>There were 50 MCQs to solve in 60 minutes.

They were helpful. One was just reading my resume and</p>\r\n<p>other was asking questions:</p>\r\n<p>1.)Tell my something about yourself.</p>\r\n<p>2.) which programming languages do you use?</p>\r\n<p>Me: C and C++.</p>\r\n<p>3.) why not java and python?</p>\r\n<p>4.) How much do you rate yourself in C and C++?</p>\r\n<p>Me: i said 6/10 for c and 5/10 for c++.</p>\r\n<p>5.) what is the difference between C and C++?</p>\r\n<p>Me: C is a procedural language but C++ is partial object oriented language. In c++ you can create</p>\r\n<p>classes but in C there is no notion of classes.</p>\r\n<p>6.) But what is the need of classes?</p>\r\n<p>Me: Sometimes there are objects who are sharing some common properties. So i can create a class</p>\r\n<p>for them and define few functions and parameteres related to that class which will be common for</p>\r\n<p>them.</p>\r\n<p>7.) But in C we can do same with structures, so why do we need classes?</p>\r\n<p>Me: Its not just the classes, C++ provides many other object oriented features like Inheritance,</p>\r\n<p>polymorphism etc. that C doesn\'t provide.</p>\r\n<p>8.) Then there were few questions from C++ like : what is constructor? What is need of them? How</p>\r\n<p>can we call constructor of base class from derived class while using inheritance, method</p>\r\n<p>overriding, create a class \'vehicle\' and create classes like car, truck etc. which will inherit vehicle</p>\r\n<p>class. Now write some functions and variables in vehicle class which are common for all vehicles</p>\r\n<p>and some in car and truck class which are specific for them. Then he asked basic questions like</p>\r\n<p>what will happen if I will create object of vehicle class or car class. Which constructor or fuction</p>\r\n<p>will get called and things like that...</p>\r\n<p>9.) Then he asked questions from C macros like what is the difference between macros and</p>\r\n<p>functions, when we should use macros, when we should use functions, what happens when a macro</p>\r\n<p>gets called and when a function gets called, write a macro that will give you maximum of 3</p>\r\n<p>numbers and few other questions on same..</p>\r\n<p>10.) Then there was a discussion on process and thread. From there he moved to</p>\r\n<p>synchronization,semaphore,mutex, what is the difference between semaphore and mutex(and he was</p>\r\n<p>not just looking for answer like \'one is binary and other is counting\'), than he asked me what could</p>\r\n<p>be the problems if i dont use synchronization: i explained consistency problem with help of</p>\r\n<p>producer/consumer problem, than few other questions from same...</p>\r\n<p>11.)Then second interviewer(who was just reading my resume till now) aksed questions like: Do</p>\r\n<p>you participate in hackathons, Is coding your passion or you are doing it to just get a job?, what is</p>\r\n<p>the longest code you have written in terms of number of lines, If we\'ll give you a problem to solve</p>\r\n<p>how much time you will take etc. etc..</p>\r\n<p>I said i am very much passionate about programming. :D Then they gave me a chance to prove it.</p>\r\n<p>They asked me to implement &ldquo;malloc&rdquo; and &ldquo;free&rdquo; function in 3 hours.</p>\r\n<p>For this i followed some blogs, read about how to create malloc and free and there were direct</p>\r\n<p>codes available on internet too.</p>\r\n<p>Round 3: (F2F/Technical)</p>\r\n<p>It was kind of stress interview. He was asking questions very fast. Although questions were not</p>\r\n<p>difficult but he was switching from one question to another so fast and he was switching the subject</p>\r\n<p>with each question too. Like 1 question from data structures then next from OS. Few questions</p>\r\n<p>which i remember:</p>\r\n<p>1. what is BST?</p>\r\n<p>2. How will you remove a node from BST? Write pseudo code.</p>\r\n<p>3. How will find inorder-successor of node? I gave him recursive solution. He said he want</p>\r\n<p>iterative solution. Than i gave a solution using parent pointer, he said what if he is not</p>\r\n<p>maintaing the parent pointer? Than i wrote one more solution.</p>\r\n<p>4. What is a system call?</p>\r\n<p>5. Explain fork?</p>\r\n<p>6. What is socket?</p>\r\n<p>7. What is the difference between logical and bitwise operators?</p>\r\n<p>8. How will you set the 13th bit of a number?</p>\r\n<p>9. How will you check if 13th bit of a number is set or not?</p>\r\n<p>10. What is pipe in linux?</p>\r\n<p>11. What is maximum value unsigned int can take? I said (231-1) . then he said write a program</p>\r\n<p>to print it. I used \'pow\' function. Than he said you cant use pow function. Then i wrote a for</p>\r\n<p>loop. But he said you cant use for loop too. Than i was thinking and he said write all the</p>\r\n<p>bitwise operators you know and tell what each of them does? I wrote all. Then he said now</p>\r\n<p>think with help of ~ operator. Then after thinking for few seconds i said ~0 will give me</p>\r\n<p>maximum value.</p>\r\n<p>Then there were few more questions that i dont rememeber right now but he asked approx. 20</p>\r\n<p>questions in this round.</p>\r\n<p>Round 4: (F2F/Technical)</p>\r\n<p>It was a simple round. Started with my introduction.</p>\r\n<p>1.) Swap 2 numbers without using third variable?</p>\r\n<p>Me: I did standard method a=a+b, b=a-b, a=a-b</p>\r\n<p>2.) when it will fail?</p>\r\n<p>Me: After thinking for sometime i said when a and b will have max_int values then a+b will cause</p>\r\n<p>the overflow.</p>\r\n<p>3.) Is there any other method to do it?</p>\r\n<p>Me: I gave him XOR method. a=a^b, b=a^b, a=a^b.</p>\r\n<p>He said this method will not work then i explained him with help of an example.</p>\r\n<p>4.) Then he asked me to explain my project followed by few questions on project.</p>\r\n<p>5.) Then he asked me 2-3 aptitiude/puzzle questions. One was geometry question related to property</p>\r\n<p>of parallel lines.</p>\r\n<p>Then he asked me 2-3 questions from mixture and allegation.</p>\r\n<p>Round 5: (F2F/HR)</p>\r\n<p>He asked my few standard questions and i gave him standard answers.</p>\r\n<p>1.) Why cisco?</p>\r\n<p>2.) Do you want job in bangalore only or anywhere is fine?</p>\r\n<p>3.) what is the one thing that you want to improve in yourself?

(I solved approx. 15 questions in less than 10mins, so you can guess the level.)</p>\r\n<p>Coding Questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Given a list of n strings group all anagrams together.</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>i/p: cat act pat mad dog god</p>\r\n<p>o/p:</p>\r\n<p>cat act</p>\r\n<p>pat</p>\r\n<p>mad</p>\r\n<p>dog god</p>\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n<p> The output was expected to be in insertion order i.e. group (&ldquo;pat&rdquo;) came before group (&ldquo;dog god&ldquo;) in the output, as in input &ldquo;pat&rdquo; came before both &ldquo;dog&rdquo; and &ldquo;god&rdquo;.</p>\r\n<p> These things will not be explicit in the questions and you need to carefully observe this when you read the question.</p>\r\n<p> Logic is very simple use sorted string as the key of the group and keep track of all strings in a group.</p>\r\n<p> Used LinkedHashMap (Java Collections) to keep track of all the groups.</p>\r\n<p> Complexity: Time O(n * (s*log(s)) Space O(n * s), where s is max(length of strings).</p>\r\n<p>Q2.</p>\r\n<p>Given a binary square matrix of size n, find the size of largest region i.e. find a region of connected ones (horizontally, diagonally, vertically).</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>i/p:</p>\r\n<p>0 1 0 0</p>\r\n<p>1 1 1 0</p>\r\n<p>0 0 1 0</p>\r\n<p>1 0 0 0</p>\r\n<p>o/p: 5</p>\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n<p> Simple BFS application to find connected components.</p>\r\n<p> Complexity: Time: O(n*n) Space O(n*n)</p>\r\n<p> Partially solved with correct approach: overlooked a test case</p>\r\n<p>Note Written Round:</p>\r\n<p> Basic questions both written and coding.</p>\r\n<p> Do not panic and stay calm, you can solve these questions very easily but when the stakes are high, believe me pressure is all you need to handle.</p>\r\n<p> I solved 18 MCQs + 1st code complete + 2nd Partial with correct approach.</p>\r\n<p> I would like to suggest that you write a two liner comment in the start of your code explaining the approach very briefly. This can help you even if you are able to solve partially.</p>\r\n<p>o Like for second question I commented as below:</p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;Using BFS module to find the connected component size and marking visited locations in the matrix so that we scan entire matrix only twice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p> Remember your competition is very limited so even if you are not able to solve everything, same might be the case with many of them so stay optimist.</p>\r\n<p>DAY 2:</p>\r\n<p>Date &ndash; 04/08/2016 (Interview Rounds)</p>\r\n<p>Round 1 (Technical Interview): (Time: 1 hr. approx.)</p>\r\n<p>The Interview started with the interviewer telling me that we don&rsquo;t have much time so he will ask few questions on data structures and algorithms and I will need to tell him the approach.</p>\r\n<p>1. Reverse a linked list.</p>\r\n<p>a. I gave two approaches, one using stack and one using pointers (in-place).</p>\r\n<p>2. Print top view of a binary tree.</p>\r\n<p>a. Well simple question but don&rsquo;t know why I started using DFS approach (Pre-Order Traversal)</p>\r\n<p>b. Tried using pre-order but he gave me test cases where it failed.</p>\r\n<p>c. Tried different approaches within pre-order found issues with one or the other test cases and I was also using HashMap to keep track of nodes to print.</p>\r\n<p>d. So he asked me to do it without auxiliary storage.</p>\r\n<p>e. I tried level order approach (w/o auxiliary HashMap) and it worked fine for all test cases.</p>\r\n<p>f. He was satisfied with the approach, so asked me to write production level code.</p>\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n<p> While writing code create methods for different operations, it looks clean and good.</p>\r\n<p> I created a class Pair(node, level) but didn&rsquo;t declare access modifiers for the class variables.</p>\r\n<p> This lead to discussion on access modifiers(public, private) , getter/ setter , private constructor, Singleton design pattern (basic idea), applications of Singleton.</p>\r\n<p> So even a small thing can lead to a discussion away from your regular interview. (In my case it proved to be a plus point as I was able to answer the questions easily).</p>\r\n<p> You can actually make such mistakes intentionally to digress the interview in a particular direction  but it may not always work :P</p>\r\n<p> Very Important: Do ask them questions, it makes them feel good and it shows that you are interested to know about the company. But do not ask anything for sake of asking, use</p>\r\n<p>something from the PPT (it shows you were attentive in the PPT) or ask them about work, technologies, etc.</p>\r\n<p>Round 2 (Technical Interview): (Time: 45mins. approx.)</p>\r\n<p>The interviewer introduced himself briefly and asked me to introduce myself. No follow up questions from the introduction (although I was hoping something on projects or company :P).</p>\r\n<p>1. Find Kth Max occurring element in the Array.</p>\r\n<p>a. Used HashMap and Heap to solve the question.</p>\r\n<p>b. Time O(n*logn)</p>\r\n<p>2. DP question: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-print-maximum-number-of-a-using-given-four-keys/</p>\r\n<p>a. Tried a lot with brute force, dp, recurrence relation, back tracking, but nothing worked.</p>\r\n<p>b. He was also solving along with me giving me hints from net(possibly geeks) at the end we finalized on a recurrence relation.</p>\r\n<p>c. Then he went out for the discussion with his other colleagues when I realised that the final approach is also not working, so when he came back I explained him that the approach doesn&rsquo;t work and he agreed.</p>\r\n<p>d. He was done asking questions, I asked him few questions about day to day work in Amazon and the interview ended.</p>\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n<p> Even if you are not able to answer the questions neatly, try various approach and think out loud (tell them what you are doing tell why you dropped an approach with some example if needed).</p>\r\n<p> This will help you in many ways:</p>\r\n<p>o It will keep the interviewer involved in the approaches you are using so if he feels that you are making a mistake he will be able to point it out rather than you wasting your time (if he wishes to help but generally they do help in Amazon interviews).</p>\r\n<p>o He will not get bored.</p>\r\n<p>o He will think that you don&rsquo;t know this problem already (even if you do :P).</p>\r\n<p>o This will give him an impression that you are able to find issues with your own approach or you are able to come up with different approaches to same problem.</p>\r\n<p>Round 3 (Technical Interview): (Time: 45mins. approx.)</p>\r\n<p>The interviewer introduced himself briefly and asked me to introduce myself. No follow up questions from the introduction again.</p>\r\n<p>He gave me a sting based question and asked me if I knew it already (which I didn&rsquo;t), so he asked me to come up with an approach.</p>\r\n<p>Q. Given a string find a repeating substring of maximum length.</p>\r\n<p>Example:</p>\r\n<p>i/p 1: banana</p>\r\n<p>o/p 1: ana</p>\r\n<p>i/p 2: india indian tt india india</p>\r\n<p>o/p 2:india india</p>\r\n<p>I thought this is it, because last round also I was unable to solve the second DP question if I do not solve this my chances will diminish. I thought of using KMP but complexity was high with this approach.</p>\r\n<p>I tried using Longest Common Substring to see if there is any pattern or way to solve it using LCS, I found an approach told it to the interviewer he was very happy with the approach, told me that he was also trying this question and his approach was complex (something tree based).</p>\r\n<p>He tried various examples to see if the approach work (which it did :D), so he asked me to code it in his laptop so that he can test it. I did it and he was satisfied with the code.</p>\r\n<p>He told that he is done with questions and asked me if I have any for him, which I did as usual.</p>\r\n<p>Note:</p>\r\n<p> Post this interview I was confident of at least the internship.</p>\r\n<p>Round 4 (Technical Interview): (Time: 25mins. approx.)</p>\r\n<p>Short round as it was my last round and I guess they were already satisfied with my performance in the last 3 interviews.</p>\r\n<p>Only one question:</p>\r\n<p>Given an infinite integer number line, find minimum steps required to reach a particular point. 0 is the starting point and at ith step we can move +i or -i steps from current position.</p>\r\n<p>Tried using tree and realised it is DP problem told him the approach and complexity and why DP and why BFS (to get minimum steps). He was satisfied with the approach.</p>\r\n<p>As always asked him about technologies used in Amazon and few other questions.</p>\r\n<p>Key Takeaways:</p>\r\n<p> Be optimist and confident even if you are not able to give exact answer to all the questions.</p>\r\n<p> Stay Calm! Stay Calm! Stay Calm!!</p>\r\n<p> Prepare your projects well (they didn&rsquo;t ask me anything on projects but they do ask and when they do you should know your projects inside out).</p>\r\n<p> For written, get familiar with syntax, for me as soon as I saw the question I was ready with logic but it took me long to figure out some basic syntax (pressure game).</p>\r\n<p> Try writing production level code on paper, so that you will code neatly on paper if they ask you to.</p>\r\n<p>ALL THE BEST  </p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 10:35:22','2017-04-06 10:35:22','Manoj Batra','Mtech it','na','NA'),(20,'NA','NA@iiitb.org',2017,'<header class=\"entry-header\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 10.8px; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;\">\r\n<h1 class=\"entry-title\" style=\"margin: 0px 0px 5px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 28px; vertical-align: baseline; clear: both; line-height: 1.2; font-weight: 400;\">Cisco Interview Experience | Set 12</h1>\r\n</header>\r\n<div class=\"entry-content\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 19px; font-family: \'Open Sans\', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align: justify;\">\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.71429;\"><strong style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">Round 1- (Written)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 10px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 1.71429;\">There were 50 MCQ questions including aptitude, technical portions.

Solved this question using BFS traversal.</p>\r\n<p>2. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-sequence-of-words-print-all-anagrams-together/</p>\r\n<p>Didn\'t have time to touch this question. Make sure your code is clean, well-written and modular. I believe they check the quality of code. 19/20 MCQs and 1 coding question got me to the interview rounds.</p>\r\n<p>F2F Interviews:</p>\r\n<p>All the panellists had GeeksforGeeks open in their laptops and were asking random questions from it.</p>\r\n<p>Round-1: The interviewer introduced me to himself and threw me the following question:</p>\r\n<p>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-number-in-minimum-steps/ I had not gone through this question before. I came with a recursive (memoized) approach which he rejected with a valid reason. Then, after thinking for some time, I suggested using binary tree data structure and explained how we can build the tree (explained in the link above). But, I couldn\'t come up with the last part of the solution which was to use level order traversal after building the tree. Later, I came to know that this question was uploaded on the GeeksforGeeks on the day of interview itself. So, make sure you go through the recent and newly uploaded problems too, after you complete a topic. Then, he asked me another question and told me that I had only 5 minutes to solve that and I only had to give approach to the problem. The question was this:</p>\r\n<p>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-sum-linked-list-two-sorted-linked-lists-common-nodes/ I told him an approach but he wanted an optimized approach which I couldn\'t think of in given time. Then, he asked me if I had any questions. I asked about the details of department and the kind of work being done in that department which he worked in. Thus, first round was over and after 10 minutes, I was informed that I had not cleared that round.</p>\r\n<p>Morgan Stanley:</p>\r\n<p>Written Test:</p>\r\n<p>20 MCQs + 2 coding questions (90 Minutes - HackerRank platform). MCQs were from OS, DBMS, CN and Aptitude. The questions were easy if your basics are clear. I solved around 18 out of 20 MCQs correctly. Coding questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Add given number of seconds to the given time in HH:MM format and show the output in HH:MM format. For example,</p>\r\n<p>Input: 23:59 122 Output: 00:02 Solved this question. I have observed that Morgan Stanley frequently asks questions regarding time, dates, days etc. So, go through in-built Date and Calendar classes in Java. They may come handy.</p>\r\n<p>2. There are n houses. The cost of moving from house i to house j is |i-j|. All houses also have one shortcut to exactly one other house which costs only 1. These shortcuts were given as an array, in which, value A[k] at index k indicates that there is a shortcut from house k to house A[k]. You have to find minimum cost to reach nth house from 1st house. I was able to pass 3 test cases out of 12 in this question.</p>\r\n<p>20 students (including me) were shortlisted for the interview.</p>\r\n<p>F2F Interviews:</p>\r\n<p>Morgan Stanley puts more emphasis on OOP concepts and Java. So, prepare them well.</p>\r\n<p>Round-1 (Technical): I was the last candidate remaining for the interview when my turn came. The interviewer started by telling me that he was running out of time and we had only 25 minutes for the interview. The first question he asked me was as following: Given a string of words, reverse the order of words without changing the order of delimiters. Anything other than A-Z and a-z should be considered as delimiter. For example, Input: Hello,&lt;SPACE&gt;there!&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;How&lt;SPACE&gt;are#*&amp;you? Output: you,&lt;SPACE&gt;are!&lt;SPACE&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;How&lt;SPACE&gt;there#*&amp;Hello? I wrote the code for the question. Think about which programming language will be more useful to write code for that particular question before starting coding. Speak out loudly what you are thinking so that the interviewer knows how you are approaching the problem. I deliberately used to speak some things loudly about the syntax, like \"This is Java, so, I will use capital \'S\' in \'String\'\", \"This is C, so, I will use 0/1 instead of false/true\". These are very minor things but they indicate that you care about the syntax and you own good coding practice. Whatever I was doing and speaking, he was observing me carefully. While I was coding for this question, he kept on asking me questions from whatever I wrote, like \"Why have you used ArrayList?\", \" What is the difference between \' String str = null \' and \' String str = \"\" \' ?\"</p>\r\n<p>After I successfully wrote code for the first question, he asked me one more coding question: Find Lowest Common Ancestor of two keys in Binary tree (NOT BST). I suggested to use parent pointers to find LCA. He said that it would require two traversals, one to create parent pointers and another to find LCA. I argued that if we insert parent pointers while building the tree, then it wouldn\'t require one extra traversal. But, he told to assume that the tree was already built (In short, he wanted me to come up with another approach). I had forgotten the approach given on GeeksforGeeks which requires only one traversal. So, I thought and came up with an approach using some colouring</p>\r\n<p>technique and recursion which required only one traversal. After I coded it, he asked me to trace it for a test case, it was working fine for the given test case. I am not sure if he was satisfied with it but he couldn\'t find any case for which it was failing. So, he moved ahead. He, then, asked me some questions like \"What is a process and what is a thread?\", \"What are the differences between a process and a thread?\", \"What resources are shared among threads of a process?\", \"Explain all access modifiers in Java.\", \"Where are class members and local variables stored in Java?\". I answered all of them. Then, he was done with his questions and asked me if I had any questions. I asked about how a fresher is trained during training/internship period. 12 out of 20, including me, cleared this round. Round-2 (Group Activity): 12 students were divided in two teams of 6. Each team was given 30 minutes to come up with a start-up idea. We were given chart papers, markers and Lego blocks using which we had to create a model. In first 15 minutes, we had to finalize the idea and in remaining 15 minutes, we had to create model. There were dedicated observers (company people) for each of the candidates who would just observe how that candidate is behaving. After you finalize the idea, one person would come and tell you that other team had same kind of idea and you might want to reconsider your idea. Then, you have to decide if you want to change your idea or modify your idea. At the end of 30 minutes, each team has to give presentation and decide a team leader among themselves. You also have to decide how much funds you need for the start-up. No one was eliminated after this round. Round-3 (HR): It lasted for more than 30 minutes. They asked me many questions which included general HR questions and questions based on scenarios. Some of them are:</p>\r\n<p> Tell me about yourself.</p>\r\n<p> What are your strengths?</p>\r\n<p> Why shouldn\'t we hire you?</p>\r\n<p> What do you think your friends will answer if they are asked about the two things you need to improve upon?</p>\r\n<p> What is your passion? How much time do you find for it?</p>\r\n<p> Have you ever gone out of your way to help your friend?</p>\r\n<p> Has it ever happened that you couldn\'t convey what you wanted to say?</p>\r\n<p> Has it ever happened that you did not agree with someone on something? Has it ever happened that somebody didn\'t agree with you on something?</p>\r\n<p> Is this the first company you have applied into? (My answer: Yes)</p>\r\n<p> In which companies, will you apply if you don\'t get selected today? (My answer: I take that decision only after reading Job Description and our placement committee hasn\'t provided any more JDs for the companies coming in future.)</p>\r\n<p> Have you ever been into leadership? If yes, How did you handle it?</p>\r\n<p>Be ready to back all your points by examples. Nobody got eliminated from this round. Round-4(Design Round):</p>\r\n<p>This is a very interesting round in which you have to design a schema for a system using class diagrams/ER diagrams/Database tables or whatever mechanism you want to use. Usually, what happens is, the interviewer gives you list of requirements which you have to incorporate in the schema. After you design it, interviewer starts modifying/updating the requirements and it\'s your job to incorporate those changes in your design. I was asked to design a system in which users can buy books and can pay for them. I came up with simple design which incorporated those requirements. Then, he added a requirement: There can be multiple discount schemes, like \"If you buy these two books, then you get this book free\", \"If you buy these three books together, then you get 20% discount on total price\" etc. After thinking for some time, I came up with modified design which included long chain of classes which were associated with one another. He wanted some other compact approach and asked me to see if I could do something with runtime polymorphism. I got the hint from that word and came up with an approach</p>\r\n<p>which was based on inheritance and runtime polymorphism. He was happy with it. He, then, asked if I had any questions to ask. I asked about the expectations from a fresher joining the company. After 4th round, they had internal discussion for about one and half hour. Finally, they selected 6 out of 12 candidates. I didn\'t get selected but it was a very nice experience.</p>\r\n<p>Infosys:</p>\r\n<p>Coding Test:</p>\r\n<p>2 coding questions (HackerRank platform) I don\'t remember the questions but I just want to make a point that read the questions carefully. In this exam, I misinterpreted a tiny part of one of the problems which made my life tough and because of that, I couldn\'t solve that problem. It just passed 3 test cases. I didn\'t solve another question as well. I didn\'t clear written test.</p>\r\n<p>Walmart Labs:</p>\r\n<p>Coding Test:</p>\r\n<p>3 coding questions (HackerEarth platform) The exam pattern was different than usual. There were no MCQs. There were just 3 coding questions. All were tough. The HackerEarth platform made everyone\'s lives even tougher. It would take 3-4 minutes to compile the program and to give you list of errors, if any. I couldn\'t solve any of the questions.</p>\r\n<p>Directi (Platform Engineer/Application Engineer):</p>\r\n<p>Coding Test - 1 (8th Aug, 2016):</p>\r\n<p>3 coding questions (90 Minutes - CodeChef platform)</p>\r\n<p>1. In a binary tree, diameter sum between two leaf nodes is defined as sum of all the nodes in the unique path when travelling from one leaf to the other. Assume that the tree is a complete binary tree and every leaf node is at the same depth from root of the tree. Find the value of maximum diameter sum in a binary tree. Note that the maximum diameter may be a single leaf node as well (since a single leaf node is also a valid diameter the trivial path of length 0 from the leaf node to itself).</p>\r\n<p>Input: First line of input is the number T, which denotes the number of test cases. Input for each case consists of 2 lines. The first line consists of the number of nodes N in the tree. The following line consists of the numbers A[1..n] which denote the value of each node in the tree. The first element in the input is the root element of the tree. Considering index of root element is 1 in the following problem, left child of ith element in the input is the (2*i)th element and right child of ith element is (2*i+1)th element. Output: Output consists of T lines denoting the value of maximum diameter sum in binary tree for each test case. Sample Input: 1 7 2 4 5 8 4 3 6 Sample Output: 22</p>\r\n<p>Explanation: Path followed to get the maximum diameter sum in this case is 8 (leaf node) =&gt; 4 =&gt; 2 =&gt; 5 =&gt; 3 (leaf node) I solved this question using recursion.</p>\r\n<p>2. You are given a grid with 3 rows and N columns. Each cell in the grid contains the value 0 initially. You perform several operations of the following type on the grid Pick a row, say r. Pick a start column and end column, say s and e. Of course 1 &le;s &le; e &le; N. Now, set all values in the grid in row r, from column s to column e to 1. After you perform all the operations, you wish to find sub-grids in this grid (or rectangles, if you please) which contain only 1s. Most importantly, you wish to find the rectangle that has the largest area. Print the area of this rectangle.</p>\r\n<p>Input: The first line of input contains a number T, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains the number N and M respectively, separated by a single space. N is the number of columns in the grid. M is the number of operations you perform on the grid. Each of the next M lines contain three integers R, C1 and C2 respectively to describe the operation. R is the row in which the operation is performed. C1 and C2 are the start and end columns respectively. You may assume that 1 &le; C1 &le; C2 &le; N. Output: For each test case output a single number on a line by itself. This number should be the area of the largest rectangle that can be chosen on the grid &ndash; which contains only 1s. Constraints: 1&le;T &le; 100, 1 &le; N &le; 1000000 1 &le; M &le; 1000</p>\r\n<p>Attention: The test data is designed such that solutions that simulate each operation in O(N) will get TLE. You should be able to solve each test case in O(N). Hint: Convert each operation to a pair of &ldquo;start&rdquo; and &ldquo;end&rdquo; events. Observe that the order of operations doesn&rsquo;t matter. Thus you can process the events in increasing order of columns. You can also simply store how many events start / end at each cell (since all events are alike and have idempotent effect). Now, you can walk through the grid column by column maintaining the longest streak of 1s towards the left in each row. This helps in considering the best possible rectangles with their right edge at current column. Sample Input: 3 5 2 1 1 4 2 3 5 10 3 1 1 8 2 2 10 3 1 9 5 2 2 1 4 3 3 5 Sample Output: 4 21 4 Explanation: In the first test case the final grid looks like, 11110 00111 00000</p>\r\n<p>We can see that the largest rectangle with 1s has the area 4. There are two such rectangles. 1,1 &ndash;1,4 and 1,3 &ndash; 2,4. In the second test case the final grid looks like, 1111111100 0111111111 1111111110 The largest rectangle is 1,2 &ndash; 3,8. The area of this rectangle is 3*7=21. I tried to solve this question using Binary Indexed Tree but it was giving \"Time Limit Exceeded\".</p>\r\n<p>3. You are given a rooted tree. The tree is not necessarily binary. The tree contains N nodes, labelled 1 to N. You are given the tree in the form of an array P[1..N] of size N. P[i] denotes label of the parent of node labelled i. For clarity, you may assume that the tree satisfies the following conditions:</p>\r\n<p> The root of the tree is labelled 1. Hence P[1] is set to 0. The parent of node T will always have a label less than T. Hence P[i] &lt; i will always be true. All nodes contain a mutable value (or, more simply, a variable), which is initially set to 0.  You are asked to perform several operations of the following type ADD X Y: add Y to the value at node X. ADDUP X Y: add Y to the value at node X. Then, add Y to the value at P[X] (i.e. the parent of X). The, add Y to the value at P[P[X]] (i.e. the parent of P[X]).. and so on, till you add Y to the value at root.  After you have performed all the given operations, you are asked to answer several queries of the following type VAL X: print the value at node X. VALTREE X: print the sum of values at all nodes in the sub-tree rooted at X (including X). Input: The first line of input contains the number T, the number of test cases. Then follows the description of T test cases. The first line of each test case contains the numbers N, M and Q respectively (separated by single</p>\r\n<p>space character). N depicts the number of nodes. M depicts the number of operations you must perform. Q depicts the number of queries you must answer. The next N lines contain a number each, depicting the array P[1..N]. Of course the number on the first such line is always 0. The next M lines contain description of the respective operation. An operation will be either &ldquo;ADD X Y&rdquo; or &ldquo;ADDUP X Y&rdquo; (without the quotes). After the operations, the next Q lines contain description of the queries. A query will be either &ldquo;VAL X&rdquo; or &ldquo;VALTREE X&rdquo; (without the quotes). Output: Print the result of each query on a line by itself. Since the answer for some queries may be too large, please print the result modulo 1,000,000,007. Do not print any blank lines between test cases. Constraints: 1 &le; T &le; 10 1 &le; N &le; 50000 1 &le; M &le; 50000, 1 &le; Q &le; 50000 1 &le; X &le; N, 1 &le; Y &le; 50000 Sample Input: 2 5 5 3 0 1 1 1 3 ADD 1 10 ADD 2 20 ADD 3 30 ADD 4 40 ADDUP 5 50 VAL 3 VALTREE 3 VALTREE 1</p>\r\n<p>7 4 5 0 1 2 2 2 1 2 ADD 6 76 ADDUP 1 49 ADD 4 48 ADDUP 2 59 VALTREE 1 VALTREE 5 VAL 5 VALTREE 2 VAL 2 Sample Output: 80 130 250 291 0 0 107 59 Explanation: In the first sample case, at the end of app the operations, the values at each of the nodes is as follows 1: 60, 2: 20, 3: 80, 4: 40, 5: 50 Also, the sum of the values of all the nodes in the sub-tree rooted at each of the nodes is as follows 1: 250, 2: 20, 3: 130, 4: 40, 5: 50. I didn\'t attempt this question.</p>\r\n<p>Only 12 to 13 students could solve one question. 1 student solved 2 questions and was called for the interview. All those who solved one question had to go through one more test. I cleared this test as I had solved one question.</p>\r\n<p>Coding Test - 2 (10th Aug, 2016):</p>\r\n<p>3 coding questions (90 Minutes - CodeChef platform)</p>\r\n<p>1. Amanada, a school kid, is learning English alphabets. Her teacher devised a small game to make the task fun. A grid of m rows and n columns is filled with English alphabets. She needs to search English words in this grid by moving one step at a time in any of the adjacent grid cells. A grid of alphabets and a set of English words are given. Amanda can start from anywhere in the grid and can move in any of the 8 adjacent grid cells, one step at a time. Each grid cell can only be used once.</p>\r\n<p>Input: You are given a template in which you need to implement a function whose signature is given below. C int findWordInAGrid(char grid[128][128], int m, int n, char word[32]) /* return 0 for false, 1 for true. */ C++ bool findWordInAGrid(char grid[128][128], int m, int n, char word[32]) Java static boolean findWordInAGridJava(char[][] grid, int m, int n, String word)</p>\r\n<p>grid[][] represents the characters that are in the given grid. Only the first m rows and the first n columns should be considered relevant. word is the word whose occurance has to be found in the grid. Remember, word may start from any location in the grid. word will never contain more</p>\r\n<p>than 30 characters. Return true if word is found in the grid, false otherwise. Output: The function should return true, if you can find the word in the grid and false otherwise. Example: Let&rsquo;s consider the grid given below: a b c d e f g h i And set of words to be searched are: abc abedhi efgh Output: The output of the above example should be: abc: true abedhi: true efgh: false I solved this problem using BFS traversal in first 15 minutes in one go. This question was similar to the following problem:</p>\r\n<p>http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boggle-find-possible-words-board-characters/</p>\r\n<p>2. https://www.codechef.com/IITD2012/problems/IITD1202</p>\r\n<p>I wrote code for this problem and it was working for given test cases but it was showing \"Wrong Answer\" when I submitted it. Later, I found a flaw in my solution.</p>\r\n<p>3. I don\'t remember this question and didn\'t attempt this.</p>\r\n<p>Directi called 3 students (including me) to their office for interviews a week after coding test-2.</p>\r\n<p>F2F Interviews (19th Aug, 2016):</p>\r\n<p>We reached their office at 12 in the noon. The interview coordinator asked us if we would like to have lunch. Then, we had our lunch and were ready for the interviews. I was taken to a room. There were 3 algo rounds out of which you have to clear at least 2 to advance to the next technical round. If you clear first 2 algo rounds, then you directly advance to the technical round. In each algo round, you have 45 minutes to solve the given problem and code it on the paper. Round-1 (Algo round): I was asked to solve following problem: You are given K boxes and N candies. Find the number of ways to distribute N candies in K boxes in such a way that each box will contain at least 1 candy. For example, if there are 3 boxes and 9 candies, then, some of the possible ways are &lt;1,2,6&gt;, &lt;1,3,5&gt;, &lt;4,2,3&gt;, &lt;4,1,4&gt;, &lt;3,3,3&gt; etc. One more constraint was that all different permutations of solution vector (&lt;1,2,6&gt;, &lt;1,6,2&gt;, &lt;6,2,1&gt; etc.) should be considered same (Order doesn\'t matter). For the sake of simplicity, I first assumed that order does matter, i.e., &lt;1,2,6&gt; and &lt;1,6,2&gt; are different solutions. I converted this problem into another problem, which is: Given an equation of K variables, x1 + x2 + ... + xK = N, find out the number of possible solutions such that values of all the variables are integers. My approach was as following: Let\'s say we want to solve equation x + y + z = 10. Here, the number of variables, K (number of boxes in original problem) is 3 and N (number of candies in original problem) is 10. Assume that we have a line of 10 dots as following: ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●</p>\r\n<p>We need to make partitions at 2 places to get 3 separate parts (K-1 partitions to get K separate parts, in general) of this line of dots. One possible partitioning can be, ● ● І ● ● ● І ● ● ● ● ● This gives us one possible solution, &lt;2,3,5&gt;. Thus, partitions at different places will give us different solution vector. The total length of the above line is (K-1) + N and we can select any K-1 places out of them as partition places. So, the total number of possible solutions to the equation will be K-1+NCK-1. For the original problem, I assigned 1 candy to each box as there must be at least 1 candy in each box. So, now, new value of N is N-K. Plugging this value into the expression above gives us N-1CK-1 as answer (Let\'s call this value ANS). After explaining him this much, he asked me about the constraint that order doesn\'t matter. I suggested to divide the ANS by K! to get final answer. But, he just wanted to make my life tougher :(. He, then, came up with cases like &lt;2,2,5&gt;. Dividing ANS by K! will work only if all elements in solution vector are different. I thought for some time but couldn\'t modify the solution to incorporate those cases. I think he was happy with wherever I got in this problem and was just trying to stretch the things to see how far I can get. Then, he asked me to code it. It was simple Dynamic Programming approach for finding nCk. I coded it. Then, he asked if I had any questions for him. I told him that I had read about Directi and I knew about its subsidiaries. I asked him to explain about the work they were doing in Bangalore office. (I asked this question intentionally because I wanted a chance to relate their work with one of my projects during my internship at IIT-Bombay). He explained me some things and I just got what I wanted. I drew him into my project from there. He was excited to know about it. He asked me to explain my project and asked me some questions from it. He also made me explain the algorithm used in it. I also asked him some specific questions about their work. I gave him an example of a situation and asked how they overcome these types of problems. He briefly explained me about it.</p>\r\n<p>Then, he told me to wait there in the room and that he would send coordinator there. After 20 minutes, coordinator came and informed me that 2nd round will start in 10 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Round-2 (Algo round): Another interviewer came and asked me following question: You are given a chocolate of dimensions x*y (chocolate made up of x*y bars of 1*1 dimensions each, with x rows and y columns in chocolate). You are also given k pairs of integers. ith pair &lt;xi,yi&gt; indicates that you can extract pieces of dimensions xi*yi (xi rows and yi columns) or yi*xi (yi rows and xi columns) from the chocolate. You can extract as many pieces as you want of the size specified by that pair (You may even choose not to extract any piece of that size at all). You can choose to extract pieces of different sizes in any order. To extract a piece, you have to cut the chocolate fully along the horizontal and vertical axes (You can\'t make an incomplete (not full) cut along the axes). Keeping these things in mind, You need to minimize the remaining part of the chocolate after extracting the pieces. For example,</p>\r\n<p>Chocolate</p>\r\n<p>Pairs</p>\r\n<p>Output</p>\r\n<p>3*2</p>\r\n<p>&lt;1,2&gt; &lt;2,2&gt;</p>\r\n<p>0 (Extract 3 pieces of &lt;1,2&gt;) or (Extract 1 piece of &lt;2,2&gt; and 1 of &lt;1,2&gt;)</p>\r\n<p>3*3</p>\r\n<p>&lt;2,1&gt; &lt;2,2&gt;</p>\r\n<p>1 (Extract 1 piece of &lt;2,2&gt; which leaves 2 pieces of size 1*3 and 2*1. Extract &lt;1,2&gt; pieces from both of them) or (Extract 4 pieces of &lt;1,2&gt;)</p>\r\n<p>2*4</p>\r\n<p>&lt;3,2&gt;</p>\r\n<p>2 (Extract 1 piece of &lt;2,3&gt;)</p>\r\n<p>2*4</p>\r\n<p>&lt;3,2&gt; &lt;1,2&gt;</p>\r\n<p>0 (Extract 4 pieces of &lt;1,2&gt;)</p>\r\n<p>After understanding the question, I started thinking different approaches. It was very obvious that greedy approach wouldn\'t work here. So, I had to go with dynamic approach. I couldn\'t think of any approach for 6-7 minutes. The interviewer wouldn\'t help me. Then, I told him that we need to try all possible ways as the order of pairs and number of times a pair can be used were not fixed. I added that I could write a recursive solution for this and later I could make it memoized recursion. As I was in the right direction, he asked me to write code for it. I gradually started writing code for it dividing the problem into smaller parts. At the end of 40 minutes, I was able to write full code (memoized recursive) for this problem. He was happy with it. Following is the solution that I came up with:</p>\r\n<p>http://ideone.com/o4DBWR He asked me if I had any questions. I asked him some general questions about the company. Then, he told me to wait there and that he would send the coordinator. Nobody came till next 40 minutes. Then, the coordinator came and informed me that my next round will start in 15 minutes and it will be taken by the Director (This was the indication that I had cleared first 2 algo rounds). She also asked me if I needed tea or coffee. I said I would have coffee. I was served coffee and while I was having it, the Director came. He told me to finish my coffee peacefully and said that he would come after 10 minutes. :)</p>\r\n<p>Round-3 (Technical round): This round is taken by a person who is at very high position, someone like Director or of equivalent position. I was a bit relaxed now as hard part was over. He started by asking me, \"Who took your first two rounds?\". I remembered the names of previous interviewers. So, I told him. He asked me to explain one of my projects. Again, I explained him about my internship project at IIT-Bombay. Then, he asked me if I was good with probability. I told him that he could ask me the question and I would try my best. Then he threw the question: Two friends are going on a trip. From a spot, they decided to go into different directions and come back at the same spot between 4 pm to 5 pm. Each of them would come back at the same spot anytime between 4 to 5, wait for 20 minutes and then go back. So, what\'s the probability that they would meet? I came up with an approach which he rejected. Then, I came up with another approach and he thought about it. I think, he was OK with whatever I came up with. Later, after the interview, I came to know that this is a geometric probability question. You can refer the following link for the solution:</p>\r\n<p>http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15448/probability-of-two-people-meeting</p>\r\n<p>Then, he asked me another question: How will you sort a 100 GB file (of integers) if you have only 4 GB RAM? I told him that we can use external n-way merge sort and explained him whole procedure. He asked me what the downsides of this solution were or in what terms, we can optimize it. I knew what he wants as an answer and I answered that, that solution was inefficient in terms of number of disk accesses. He further asked how we can optimize it then. I told him that we can divide RAM into 25 (100/4) input buffers and 1 output buffer. We can apply tournament sort to elements of input buffers. Whenever any of the input buffers is empty, it will be reloaded from corresponding chunk of file (In external sort, 100 GB file was divided into 25 chunks of 4 GB). Whenever output buffer is full, it\'s content will be dumped into disk. He, then, asked how we can optimize this in terms of number of</p>\r\n<p>comparisons. I, then, replaced tournament sort with heap sort. He was convinced now. He, then, asked me to write code for this whole procedure assuming that library functions for sorting and reloading the input buffers are provided to me. Fortunately, I remembered the syntax of FILE I/O in C. So, I wrote full code for dividing a 100 GB file into chunks. Then, for the remaining part, I wrote pseudo-code using those two functions. He was happy with it. I had gone through following articles/tutorials during my placement preparation which came handy to me while answering this question:</p>\r\n<p> http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/external-sorting/</p>\r\n<p> http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tournament-tree-and-binary-heap/</p>\r\n<p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WGaT0-gYCQ</p>\r\n<p>Then, he was done with the questions and asked me if I had any questions. I asked some questions about the training period, expectations from a fresher joining the company etc. Then, he told me to wait there and that he would send the coordinator there and left. Nobody showed up for next one hour. Then, a lady came just to inform me to wait more. :( More 30 minutes passed. And the coordinator finally showed up. She informed me that she was informed from her colleague at Bombay (Headquarter) that I was done for the day and they already had sent me the result in mail and that I could leave. I was like \"Why can\'t you tell me the result to my face now? :(\". She gave me some goodies and dropped me outside. Then, I checked my mail and found that the mail had arrived after 10-15 minutes of the last technical round while I was waiting for the result and doing nothing. I was offered internship and full time job as Platform Engineer. :) So, this is how my placement journey came to an end. The last point that I would like to mention is, prepare well, give your 100%, but stay oblivious to the results. Just keep working hard and eventually, everything will sum up for good. :)</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 10:43:59','2017-04-06 10:43:59','Bhavik','Mtech it','NA','NA'),(23,'NA','na@iiitb.org',2017,'<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm .15pt .15pt -.25pt;\">Hello guys!!</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0cm 9.95pt .15pt -.25pt;\">Have patience, this is going to be 5-6 pages write up.

Have faith on yourself, after all you are an IIITBian and you&rsquo;ll surely land up in any any RnD or product based company. Some get it a month early and some a month later.

After introducing myself I quickly jumped into project I did in WSL lab. It was based on semantic web technology.&nbsp; He asked few questions from this topic. Then he asked me which language I code in. I told python. He asked me to write a python program to read a file and count number of time each word appears in that file and return top 10 words. I wrote the program and showed it to him. He then asked me what would I do if the file I&rsquo;m reading was 100GB. I told him to split the file into number of smaller files and process each file separately. He asked me how do I split the file. (I forgot the linux command to split files) I told him that there is a linux command to split the files but I forgot. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The he asked me to write a program for breadth first search.

I told I&rsquo;m not confident with OS and so I may not be able to answer questions from OS but ill give it a try. He said then there is no point in asking questions from os and asked me which areas I&rsquo;m strong in. I told him to ask questions from stats or machine learning. He told he is not strong in that area. He then told me that he will ask some logical questions. He started with few simple puzzles. Then some simple probability questions like if there is a box with 3 red socks and 3 black socks and if u pick a socks at random wat is the probability that it is a red one. Finally he asked me a really difficult puzzle. He explained the question for 5 mins . I was not able to answer this question&nbsp; but I was keep asking questions. Each time he gave me a clue that led to the answer. I was close to answer&nbsp; but didn&rsquo;t answer it completely. I think he didn&rsquo;t expect the correct answer but only tested how I approached the problem.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Round 4 (Managerial round. )</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">A pretty easy round.

In between he asked me write some code as well on JSP, JQuery , Java- Backend coding etc...</p>\r\n<p>Ques: Finally he came to SQL as well ?</p>\r\n<p>He asked me to write queries, then some questions on stored procedures , triggers , joins, etc...</p>\r\n<p>Finally he doesn\'t look so impressed with me and said me \"Thank you\" .</p>\r\n<p>I wasn\'t able to make it for the HR Round.</p>\r\n<p>Over all Intel Experience: some people had 2-3 rounds and some people had 4-5 rounds , it all depends on your resume getting shortlisted on the number of departments came for the interviews.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco Experience:</p>\r\n<p>Pattern of written exam questions varies every year, our seniors had very easy paper but ours was tough...only 60 out of 130 cleared written exam whereas the stats in our senior batch was 88/140(approx)...So my advice is don\'t things for granted....work hard for the written as well.</p>\r\n<p>Written Exam : Pen Paper - 1 hour , 50 Objective type Questions (20 Aptitude + 30 Technical Questions) ,</p>\r\n<p>NO NEGATIVE MARKING</p>\r\n<p>Aptitude Questions: Medium Level - Series,probability,clocks, problem on ages, mathematical solving questions , trigonometry, Venn diagram,assertion and reasons...</p>\r\n<p>Most of questions are general problem solving questions instead of focusing on hard core topics like Time and distance, time work,SI,CI etc...But prepare all type of questions...</p>\r\n<p>Technical Questions : Medium - Easy level - 5-6 C output questions on pointers , functions , arrays, union , structures, pointers with functions as well., DS and Algo basic questions , 5-6 Networking questions , some ELECTRONICS subject questions,some questions form OS and Digital electronics and from computer architecture as well - mantissa , Multiplexer, Counters,etc..</p>\r\n<p>To clear exam:</p>\r\n<p>Try to solve most of the aptitude questions.17 or 18 questions out of 20 questions.</p>\r\n<p>If you are from CS background - focus on your subjects and C language and If you are from Non- CS background - focus on electronics subject questions and C language.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you are CS or Non- CS , you can easily solve around 15/30</p>\r\n<p>so the final will be 17+ 15 = 32/50, good enough to clear written. I also solved 34/50</p>\r\n<p>Interview Rounds : Conducted under 3 departments (IT dept, Software Engineering dept, and Networking dept) for which you have to fill the choice even before appearing for the written exam.</p>\r\n<p>2-3 rounds (1 or 2 Technical rounds and 1 HR round) - depends on the department</p>\r\n<p>I had 1 Technical + 1 HR Round</p>\r\n<p>During PPT , they said they will hire full time + intern in Networking and SE Profiles and only internship for IT Profile</p>\r\n<p>I opted for SE Profile ...Before the Technical Round, HR called me and said my written marks are not good enough for SE profile and he sent me for the IT Profile interview (same thing happened with</p>\r\n<p>many people as they had to switch profiles before interview...It usually doesn\'t happens but It happened during our batch). I didn\'t thought too much about it as I didn\'t had the internship till that time and they were offering only internship in IT Profile.I went for it.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Round: (Two on one) - IT Profile</p>\r\n<p>Both the interviewers explained about their department and kind of work they do and then started with the 1st obvious question...</p>\r\n<p>1st Ques: Tell me about yourself? (Again I started driving my interview my way as I am always prepared well for this answer and I know where to take my interview from this point!!)</p>\r\n<p>As usual I ended my intro with major projects I have worked on during last 1 year.</p>\r\n<p>2nd Ques: He told to explain one project?</p>\r\n<p>Since the interviewers were sitting away from me, I took the initiative to explain the project in the White board starting with the purpose of the project, team size and then with proper diagrams, architecture and finally explaining about he technologies used.</p>\r\n<p>They got impressed with that!!</p>\r\n<p>3rd Ques: About My Industry Experience? The Projects I have worked on?</p>\r\n<p>(...)</p>\r\n<p>4th Ques : Since I had written many languages and technologies on my resume, Interviewer asked me which language I am comfortable with and why? and the some chaining questions on that</p>\r\n<p>I was expecting that he will make me write some code after that, but he didn\'t told me to do so....he got convinced about my abilities from my words only.</p>\r\n<p>5th Ques: Interviewer went through my resume and saw two of my old projects(since I had mentioned the time duration of my projects, he picked old ones) and told me explain both of them one by one.</p>\r\n<p>Again I stood up and explained both projects one by one in the White Board...Interesting thing was that they didn\'t interrupted me anytime, they listened to me until I chose to spoke, didn\'t even ask a</p>\r\n<p>single question in between..don;t know what they were trying to judge.Good for me as I didn\'t had to answer there chaining questions.</p>\r\n<p>6th ques: What was the worst experience on my project and how I handled the situation?</p>\r\n<p>Here I got the chance to explain my another project. I started by giving the real experience I had/suffered while working on the Data Modelling project.</p>\r\n<p>Hence I was able to mention and explain my another project as well and they got convinced with my answers as well since they asked few questions in between while i was answering.</p>\r\n<p>7th ques: Then Interviewer asked me about the best project and why I think it was the best one?</p>\r\n<p>I answered diplomatically about the two projects and then finally shared the working experience on one of the projects giving proper relevant examples to prove why it was the best one and again they got impressed (I guessed because they were always smiling!! a good sign)</p>\r\n<p>Finally they gave me chance to ask few questions? I asked them 2-3 questions to them, basically to show my interest towards the job :)</p>\r\n<p>and finally they said \"Thank you\" and opened the door for me :)</p>\r\n<p>After waiting for 15- 20 minutes they called 8 of us in the room where all the Interviewers were present and they said we all 8 are through from their side and now it all depends on HR to decide.</p>\r\n<p>After 2-3 hours , our HR round happened together for all 8 people</p>\r\n<p>HR Round:</p>\r\n<p>Since we all 8 people were there ,questions were open to all.</p>\r\n<p>Introduce yourself?</p>\r\n<p>Why Cisco?</p>\r\n<p>Tell me few good things and few bad things about Cisco?</p>\r\n<p>(We listened well during PPT and hence was able to tell bad things as well about Cisco, because HR forced us to say bad things as well)</p>\r\n<p>Then HR discussed and told a lot of things about Cisco and after some time it went into discussion round, we started asking silly questions and lot of questions to HR and it went up to some 30 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>and Finally after some time results were declared and we all 8 got the internship IT Profile!! :) :D</p>\r\n<p>and the surprise part was....next day Cisco announced the full time offer as well for all the 8 IT Profile guys!! :)</p>\r\n<p>For SE , they took a Pen paper coding round test for half an hour. and finally selected only 1 candidate at the end.</p>\r\n<p>Well this was only for IT Profile, please look out for other profile experience as well...they had different kind of interviews unlike the IT Profile.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reading my experience and hope this will help you in your placements....All the best!!</p>\r\n<p>You can always reach out to me for any further queries..</p>\r\n<p>Ankit Narang</p>\r\n<p>ankit.narang@iiitb.org</p>\r\n<p>ankit.5389@gmail.com</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>1. Projects : Choose your projects very well (if you have the option) and work hard on the project. Learn the part of the project which you are not doing as well.. I just meant you should have sound knowledge of the whole project because in Interviews , you have to explain the whole project and Interviewer can ask any part of it..Have good knowledge of the technologies and ideas used in the project. Know about the cause of making the project</p>\r\n<p>2.Coding: Never ever stop coding until you get placed (even after that you can do,its personal choice) Lot of companies specially the good ones have coding round as their 1st or 2nd round,Some</p>\r\n<p>are online and some are in paper (hand written). Make habit of coding in paper pen also while you think of the approach before coding.</p>\r\n<p>If you start coding at least 1-2 questions daily, you will cover a lot before placements and then no one can stop you from cracking the coding round easily. Work hard on it...Once you start coding well, try to improve the efficiency of your code (in terms of complexity I am talking)</p>\r\n<p>3.Work Experience : This helps a lot. At least for me , it helped me during interviews. While telling about yourself you can give a brief explanation of your work experience (even if it is less than a year...it matters) While asnwering any question, you can easily relate it to your work experience...some interviewers prefer work ex guys, because they can straight away start working on the project once they join their company.</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>My personal advice is if you are looking for the big fish, start working from the day itself...Even if you give 1-2 hours of preparation time for the placement...you will easily get a lot of knowledge before placement starts.</p>\r\n<p>Plan your work and work accordingly..</p>\r\n<p>Prepare your resume well for different companies, you can have different resumes.(know about the company well in advance)</p>\r\n<p>Know your resume well...whatever you have written in your resume , you should know each and everything.Take the guidance of seniors while preparing your resume.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on basics of everything - C,C++, Java ,OOPS , DS,OS, Networks, DBMS...try to solve as many question on that as you can.</p>\r\n<p>Focus more on Data Structure concepts.Start solving Karumanchi and Cracking the coding interview , geeksforgeeks</p>\r\n<p>Before the placement, focus on aptitude questions as well covering all the topics.</p>\r\n<p>Work on all the previous GATE questions for all the subjects (you will get them easily in geeksforgeeks)</p>\r\n<p>Prepare well for Managerial and HR questions if you are not a good speaker, because it is all about sharing your experience and relating things which you already know while answering any question.</p>\r\n<p>Well that\'s it from my side....Thanks...hope my advices will help you...All the best!!</p>\r\n<p>If you need anything , we seniors are always there for you to help..Ask Ask Ask....that\'s all you have to do...Thanks again :)</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 10:59:07','2017-04-06 10:59:07','Ankit Narang','Mtech it','NA','NA'),(27,'NA','NA@iiitb.org',2017,'<p>Name:</p>\r\n<p>Bhardwaj Ramkumar</p>\r\n<p>Experiences:</p>\r\n<p>Amazon: Wasn\'t really prepared for the very first drive. Attended the programming round alone. The learning here is to focus on some competitive programming problems from online judges like SPOJ, HackerRank or HackerEarth.</p>\r\n<p>FlipKart: Same as above, just that here the importance was given to the design of code more than the final output and number of test cases run. After all, a huge company would obviously want readable, manageable code rather than correctness. The learning here is to focus on design principles.</p>\r\n<p>Cisco: The first aptitude test is merely a speed test, you need to be quick at math and puzzle solving. Do not stay on one question for long. Technical questions were not many apart from some basic error-checking and networking related questions. Interviews happen for three different domains. I was in the Engineering panel where they had asked me to write a program implementing a circular linked list such that we can read, insert and delete in a simultaneous fashion. The condition was not to use semaphores. Apart from this there were questions on cryptography and OS. (one question was on thrashing)</p>\r\n<p>Fiberlink: The written test was very simple (maybe because I had experience in giving so many of them). There were two panes here: Dev and QA. I had opted for the QA profile where the majority of the questions were puzzles. The famous matchstick and time measurement question was also asked.</p>\r\n<p>Cerner: Qualified the written test here, this one was also very simple. Interview questions asked revolved around Java Spring, POJO and OOP concepts.</p>\r\n<p>Tyfone: NO written here, Interview was kind of simple with questions being asked from recursion and DP.</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>Coding competitions give you a ticket for the interview rounds. The more we practice problems online and get to know our own mistakes trying to optimize the solution as far as possible, the better we will be as programmers. While writing code make sure you comment whenever possible so that you yourself could understand of what you were thinking at that time. Follow coding conventions and proper indentations. Trust me companies look at that primarily. Doesn\'t matter if</p>\r\n<p>you are Thomas Cormen with respect to algorithms, but if you suck at following conventions, then you\'re the loser.</p>\r\n<p>I did not have any work ex per se, but I believe that work ex could make you aware of the recent technologies that the industry uses. Stuff like RESTful, Struts, Spring was very very new to me.</p>\r\n<p>Projects if done sincerely do help in ways you can never expect!</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>Make a resolution to atleast do one code before you sleep. I know I myself haven\'t followed that but I could see people benefiting tremendously from that. If you are not able to solve the first problem quickly, then do not worry, take your time (days) but solve it yourself. Start with the very basic Fibonacci. That\'s how I did.</p>\r\n<p>All the best!! :) I know for a fact that your batch is much more programming-savvy than ours. Just keep that up and it will bring you wonders.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 11:00:52','2017-04-06 11:00:52','Ramkumar Bhardwaj ','Mtech it','NA','NA'),(28,'NA','NA@iiitb.org',2013,'<p>Name:</p>\r\n<p>Bhuvanesh Srivastava</p>\r\n<p>Experiences:</p>\r\n<p>COMPANY NAME: AmEx (Gurgaon)</p>\r\n<p>I think this post will help my NCE classmates/juniors :)</p>\r\n<p>Many people have asked me to write about my AmEx(American Express) interview experience.

Finally, i went into the interview room with resume unstapelled and me unprepared !!! I had nothing to loose but an interview experience to gain :)</p>\r\n<p>So this is what happened in the interview (an abstract view):</p>\r\n<p>(There were 2 interviewers)</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: Tell me about yourself? ---&gt; This is your biggest chance to drive the interviwe your way, our seniors hav also said this..</p>\r\n<p>Me: I told him about my school,college,GATE and IIITB. Then i have told him about Projects i did (which were all NCE and OS related stuffs, nothing to do with DB). Then i just started telling him about my strong liking FOR ROUTERS &amp; COMPUTER VISION stuffs. I have also published a paper on computer vision and one paper on Router is pending, i have told him that..</p>\r\n<p>Interviewer: You have done nothing related to DB, why do you think that you are appropriate for this profile?</p>\r\n<p>Me: (Before answering this, i feel that i owe an apology to DB people) :P</p>\r\n<p>I said, \"When i came to this college then my main aim was to build a router (or a part of it in my own way) and work on Computer Vision because of which i took NCE branch. My one Paper has been published in Computer vision and one paper on Routers will be published very soon. So my main aim of coming in M.Tech. is over. Now, i want to work in DB field that is why i want to join your company. :P Moreover,i had written in my Resume \'in BOLD\' that i know SQL and UML but right now i don\'t remember anything as i had studied DB in 1st semester</p>\r\n<p>and i feel like it is pure logic,in which i am very good at, and anyone can do it in a week :P \".</p>\r\n<p>(Both of them looked at each other, i don\'t know why :D )</p>\r\n<p>Then the main Interview started..</p>\r\n<p>He asked me to choose a language in which i can code. I have choosen C. Then he asked me some simple coding problems which i did in (may be) a minute or so (believe me that was easy).</p>\r\n<p>Then he gave some logical questions which i was able to solve.</p>\r\n<p>After that he asked me to explain one of my projects (i obviously took my published Paper project) and explained him in great detail.</p>\r\n<p>Then he started asking some questions in C and Java, some of them were good and some were very easy. One of the questions which i was not able to answer was:</p>\r\n<p>\"How do you implement OOPS concept in C ?\". But after sometime, just before finishing the interview he asked me last question: \"What are structures?\" .....</p>\r\n<p>This was a hint actually for previous question which i immidiately figured out somehow. Then i explained about structures and said that we can implement OOPS in C using structures.</p>\r\n<p>SOME OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS ASKED FROM ME ARE:</p>\r\n<p>&gt; You have two sand glasses. One is of 7 minutes and the other one is of 4 minutes. How can you correctly calculate 9 minutes ?</p>\r\n<p>&gt; When do we prefer to use Arrays and When we use Link list? (While giving answer to this question i have figured out that both the interviewers don\'t know OS so while giving the answer for this, i somehow managed to get Memeory managemant and Embedded Systems in it. And finally proved by giving a practical example,which he might know already, that i am correct) :P .</p>\r\n<p>&gt; What is Encapsulation in java and how can we achieve it in C ?</p>\r\n<p>&gt; What are constructors and destructors?</p>\r\n<p>&gt; Two coding question:</p>\r\n<p>1. Write a code to reverse a number? :P :P</p>\r\n<p>2. WAP to print this:</p>\r\n<p>1</p>\r\n<p>2 3</p>\r\n<p>4 5 6</p>\r\n<p>7 8 9 10</p>\r\n<p>Duration of interview: 25 mins (approx)</p>\r\n<p>Result: Got internship in AmEx Gurgaon</p>\r\n<p>.................................................................................</p>\r\n<p>.................................................................................</p>\r\n<p>COMPANY NAME: National Instruments</p>\r\n<p>It is hardcore EC &amp; Computer Vision company.

Questions asked were very good. (You can compare it with one asked in Amazon)</p>\r\n<p>Duration of interview: 1.5 to 2 hours (each)</p>\r\n<p>My Interview Experience:</p>\r\n<p>(There were 2 interviewers)</p>\r\n<p>When i got in then they asked me to introduce myself. After that, they asked me if they can get a copy of my Computer Vision paper that i have recently published. I asked them to search on google and they got it.</p>\r\n<p>Then the lady interviewer literally read the whole 6 pages paper in about 15 mins. In that 15 mins the male interviewer was asking me question like:</p>\r\n<p>1. What is the difference between source and channel coding?</p>\r\n<p>2. What is Gaussian noise?</p>\r\n<p>3. Write a code to find the length of an array in the most effective way?</p>\r\n<p>4. What is ISI(Inter Symbol Interfearence ).</p>\r\n<p>Ok, then after having read my paper, the lady interviewer asked me to explain the paper.. And while i was explaining it to her, she was constantly asking me HOW, WHY, WHY NOT SOMETHING ELSE, CAN YOU COME UP WITH SOME OTHER ALGORITHM etc ..</p>\r\n<p>Interviewers even asked me if i have done any Machine learning course.. I said NO. So, they have explained me one of the machine learning concepts and then they have asked me to implement that concept on my paper. (Basically they want to check how sound you are in the subjects and how quickly you can imbibe new topics)</p>\r\n<p>Well, i think i have implemented it upto an extent they want from me. In all, they took about 1 hour on my paper.</p>\r\n<p>Then, they asked me about 2 other projects. One was on Operating Systems and Other one was on Routers.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, they have asked some questions like:</p>\r\n<p>1. How do you find your coding round? Can you device an even better algorithm than what you have written in coding round?</p>\r\n<p>2. What do you mean by standard deviation in Gaussian function?</p>\r\n<p>3. What is fourier transform and fourier series? How can you physically interpret it?</p>\r\n<p>4. Some linear mathematics questions like: Rank-Nullity theorem , what is the significance of \'Eigen vectors\' (in terms of Basis) etc ? (i don\'t remember all)</p>\r\n<p>5. Condition for an LTI System to be stable, causal ?</p>\r\n<p>6. How to determine if a system is stable or not by seeing at ROC of discreat system and continuous system?</p>\r\n<p>7. Given a system, can we always find its output using convolution? When we cannot(if you answered NO for previous)? And in that case, how can you find the output of the system?</p>\r\n<p>(Ans 7: Think about, Why we use State Space Analysis in control systems and you will get your answer)</p>\r\n<p>Ok, then finally they asked some HR questions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Why NI?</p>\r\n<p>2. How are your projects &amp; papers will be helpful to the company?</p>\r\n<p>3. When can you join?</p>\r\n<p>4. Is there any location of your preference? etc..</p>\r\n<p>_____________________________________________________</p>\r\n<p>I hope this will help you all juniors.</p>\r\n<p>Study and learn first in the domain in which you really feel you came here to do M Tech and try to reach on top (in terms of gaining knowledge).</p>\r\n<p>If you are enthusiastic enough towards the work you do then it will be automatically shown in the interview and your 50% of the work is done .</p>\r\n<p>ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR FUTURE.. :)</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>In AMEX: Interviewers did saw the projects but haven\'t asked much.

Multiple groups from the company gave a brief introduction about the work they did during the PPT. The groups had already decided which students they were going to interview. Some students were interviewed (technical) by more than one group, and others by only one. A behavioral interview followed for those who cleared at least one technical interview (I think so).</p>\r\n<p>My Experience:</p>\r\n<p>Technical Interview 1 &ndash; PC Clients Group</p>\r\n<p>He asked me about two of my projects &ndash; Dial a Ride and Facebook Prototype. He was more interested in the former as it involved algorithms. I guess he didn\'t show much interest in Facebook as it\'s a web application. He asked Java/OOP related questions. Then he told me to implement the strcpy function from string in C. After that, he gave me the 4 queens puzzle. The interview went on for about 20 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Interview 2 &ndash; Web Services Group (I think this was the name)</p>\r\n<p>He asked me about my projects. He was particularly interested in Facebook Prototype. He went deeper into the technologies involved namely Java, Struts and JSP. He asked me a little bit about C# as well. He gave me two tables and some expected outputs and asked me to write the SQL query for each. The interview went on for over 45 minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Behavioral Interview</p>\r\n<p>He described a few situations and asked me how I\'d handle them.

There was no behavioral/HR interview. In the programming part, they also look for modularity, proper indentation, variable and method names etc. The interviews are all about data structures, algorithms and puzzles. Just make an honest effort to solve and the interviewers will be helpul.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Interview 1</p>\r\n<p>He asked me to solve some of the MCQs I did not solve during the test. Then he asked me to solve the following:</p>\r\n<p>1) Find if a linked list has a loop. If yes, find the first node of the loop.</p>\r\n<p>2) N unique numbers are stored in an array of size N+1. One number repeats obviously. You have to find which one. This one is easy and there are many ways to do it. He wanted to see how many solutions I could come up with.</p>\r\n<p>A few more algorithms and stuff.. I don\'t remember.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Interview 2</p>\r\n<p>1) SQL queries</p>\r\n<p>2) A puzzle &ndash; There are 5 robbers (r5, r4, r3, r2, r1). They have robbed a hundred coins. r5 is the leader. He gets to choose how many coins to keep for himself. He then gives the remaining coins to the remaining robbers. r5 goes home happily with his share, the next robber in the sequence is the new leader and the same logic continues. At any stage, the split has to be agreed upon by at least 50% of all robbers including the leader. If not, the remaining robbers kill the leader and the next robber in the sequence (the new leader) gets all coins the leader had and has to split them and it goes on. You have to find what is the maximum number of coins r5 can keep without getting killed.</p>\r\n<p>Some more stuff.. I don\'t remember exactly.</p>\r\n<p>Technical Interview 3</p>\r\n<p>He asked me about my project Facebook Prototye. He then gave me an n-ary tree asked me to come up with the Node class structure and algorithms for locking, indirect locking and freeing the tree nodes under some constraints. We discussed a lot and optimized the algorithms as much as we could. Then he asked me to implement the complete thing in Java. After that, he asked me if I had any questions for him. This interview went on for over an hour I guess.</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve written everything in the next section.</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>E-commerce companies love data structures like trees and algorithm techniques like DP. Take up programming challenges on hackerrank, codechef etc. Geeks for geeks is a very good place for various resources. Don\'t just start solving problems. Work on your concepts, algorithms and techniques. Think about them. Understand them. They are the building blocks of any solution. Develop intuition. And then solve problems. That will make you good at these things.</p>\r\n<p>Being able to write programs on paper is important. Know at least one procedural programming language (like C) and at least one object-oriented programming language (like Java, C#). Knowing a functional programming language (like OCaml) may be a plus. For the OOP language you choose, make sure you\'re able to write simple programs in plain Notepad and on paper. Your projects are going to matter a lot. So, put your honest efforts in whatever projects you do. Try and do relevant and meaningful projects which will add value.</p>\r\n<p>My previous work experience did help me. I wanted a web application development job (e-commerce in particular) and my prev work ex is mostly scripting and procedural programming. Sure, it didn\'t help much directly, but then it has made me a better coder for sure and that counts.</p>\r\n<p>Hope this helps. Thanks for your time.</p>\r\n<p>Also I\'d like to take this opportunity to thank the junior placement volunteers for all their efforts.</p>\r\n<p>All the best. :)</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 11:07:46','2017-04-06 11:07:46','Dnyanesh Joshi','Mtech it','na','NA'),(31,'NA','NA@iiitb.org',2012,'<p>Name:</p>\r\n<p>Harsha N Bhushan</p>\r\n<p>Experiences:</p>\r\n<p>Company: National Instruments (RF Algorithm profile- purely DSP and Maths)</p>\r\n<p>Rounds: 3</p>\r\n<p>Round 1: coding (given a sequence of moves on tic tac toe game, predict who the winner is for 3X3 and NXN tic tac toe)</p>\r\n<p>Round 2: Technical + 2 HR questions</p>\r\n<p>Round 3: Technical + 2 HR questions</p>\r\n<p>Questions: purely DSP,Wireless communication,Linear algebra</p>\r\n<p>Some questions:Digital Communication, wireless:</p>\r\n<p>1.

Both companies were very different interviews so I\'ll list them out in order:</p>\r\n<p>- Dreamworks:</p>\r\n<p>Dreamworks doesn\'t visit campus, but instead does their whole process online/via phone. We had one online round and one telephonic round. The online round was very doable with pretty easy MCQs+coding questions. The telephonic round was also pretty straightforward. Dreamworks wants horizontal people, i.e people who have good knowledge across different domains, not just deep knowledge in one field. The interview also tested concepts across different domains, but was never very deep in any domain.</p>\r\n<p>One thing Dreamworks does which no other company does which no other company does is ask for a Statement of Purpose as well as Faculty recommendation letters. Personally I feel this plays a big role in deciding the candidates. The statement of purpose needs to show how the internship will be good for both you and the company, and the recommendation letters are meant to show the faculty backing your claims. I had a kickass recco by Raghavan Sir, and I honestly believe that played a role in me getting the position.</p>\r\n<p>Dreamworks pays attention to your previous achievements quite a bit. They are looking for well rounded resumes. Things like open source contributions, events participated in, leadership experience etc all give brownie points with DreamWorks.</p>\r\n<p>- Bloomreach</p>\r\n<p>Bloomreach had a very unique process for interviews. They had an open ended programming exercise (which was do design a movie recommender using data of IMDB Top 250) which was given 36 hours before the interview day. We had 24 hours to come up with an algorithm, code it and provide an writeup explanation for the algorithm we\'ve used. While it wasn\'t mentioned during the interviews, during a team lunch we had with their team, they said they actually went through ALL the writeups and the code submitted. Mainly what they look for in this round is the logic applied when approaching open ended questions, and the compromises you\'re ready to make in your design. On the day of campus visit, we had the usual MCQ+Coding online round followed by 4 rounds of interviews.</p>\r\n<p>The online round had 3 coding questions. The first round of interviews was almost entirely based on the mistakes made in the online coding round. There was one question that I didn\'t know how to solve and the interviewer kept pushing me to get the solution to that problem. The other rounds were almost completely focused on data structures and algorithms. All rounds had one central</p>\r\n<p>question which needed to be solved which was either solved in parts, or whose solution was used to solve a different problem.</p>\r\n<p>One of the rounds was to implement search algorithms in an array where the difference between any two consecutive elements is at most abs(1) eg. [1 2 3 2 2 1 1 2]. I had to implement about 6 algorithms for the same problem, each with different tradeoffs eg. only check for presence not location, return difference between first and last occurence, use preprocessing to make actual search O(1) etc.</p>\r\n<p>All rounds were simply looking at algorithmic logic, and barely anything else.</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>Projects were an icebreaker in almost every interview I gave. I have a couple of projects that I\'m really proud of so they were almost always the interview openers. Starting off talking about a good project generates a very strong first impression</p>\r\n<p>Coding competitions were helpful for getting past the coding rounds. Anyone with decent to above-decent coding skills will be very comfortable with the level of problems. Usually coding parts of online tests have questions of different levels, and besides one question (which is usually tough), you should be comfortable solving all others. Most companies looking for algorithmic logic don\'t force you to write code as long as you can write explainable pseudo code. But strong coding skills is always a win.</p>\r\n<p>Work experience didn\'t really help directly in any way, except in Dreamworks I was asked if I\'ve worked in an Agile environment (which I had at my workplace), and Bloomreach actually increased my base salary (and consequently CTC) because I had prior work experience. Besides this, tangibly, there was no difference.</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>Practise coding and algorithms. It\'s all about logic. Most good interviewers will guide you towards the answer, but you just need to catch onto the hints they give. Be strong in basic data structures (Array, LL, Trees, Graphs), and the major programming paradigms (Greedy, Backtracking, Dynamic Programming etc). You need to be able to look at a problem and say which datastructures and what paradigm you can use to solve the problem. All of this comes ONLY from practise.</p>\r\n<p>Different companies have different tactics. For eg. Amazon has this tactic where simply byhearting Geeks4Geeks all but guarentees that you\'ll be through atleast to the final rounds of interviews,</p>\r\n<p>while mentioning that you prefer Gurgaon as a work location gives you a strong advantage with AmEx. So learn about different companies experiences and prepare accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>Many people do a first come first serve when it comes to companies. This is a bad strategy unless you want a backup offer and have plans to apply offcampus to some place. If not, even if you get through a company early on for a profile you don\'t particularly like, you will definitely be disappointed when people get through companies offering profiles you wanted at higher packages. It\'s always better to go through JDs and apply for companies only if they actually appeal to you.</p>\r\n<p>Have a strong resume. Have your projects listed properly. Many of us have gotten placed majorly on the basis of projects we\'ve done.</p>\r\n<p>Know that we\'re being compared with students from the top IITs and NITs (Most companies visit us 1-2 weeks before/after an IIT/NIT). So you need to prove your mettle. We\'ve had companies praise as well as criticize our student pool. We need to increase the list of companies doing the former and decrease the ones doing the latter.</p>\r\n<p>All the best guys.

If you are thorough with your project, (mark my words), you will have chance of getting selected in the very first or second month of placement season. You can spend almost half of the time of your interview by just running the interviewer through your resume discussing every bit of your project to as much depth as you can. Try to participate in coding competitions as much as possible because if nothing, atleast you will learn how to think in different ways for a given problem and you will get to see live the so called time constraint factor effect where you will have idea, you will have lines of code to write but what you will be missing most is the TIME . So practice it as much as you can.</p>\r\n<p>Since i had no previous workEx, so can\'t say about it.</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>Just one line. Start coding as much as you can from the day you read this because there is no other way out. Atlast, I would like to conclude by saying that during your placements, until unless you don\'t get placed, on every morning when you get up, just say to yourself atleast once that today is your day and by the EOD, you are going to be placed. Believe me, this confidence will boost your energy and you will see miracles happening. And the most important thing to remember is \"NEVER GIVE UP\" attitude. Let them reject you as much as they can but what all you have to do is preparing for next opportunity with double the energy.

The time limit was 30 mins.</p>\r\n<p>--Interview:</p>\r\n<p>**Since, they are a startup, they will definitely go for people having same profiles as they demand. For us, what they had mentioned in the job description was totally different than what they had actually come for (I came to know that during my interview itself). I was the last one to face the interview. So, they wanted to complete my interview at the soonest. But, I kept them asking me questions. They started with \"difference between hashmap and hashtable\", I answered that correctly and to impress them I wrote two examples on how to write their syntax while giving their differences. Since, there were two people, one was asking me questions while the other was busy checking out my resume and asking me questions related to it. From the second interviewers questions, his interaction with me and his expressions on seeing my resume (He was literally digging deep into my resume and asked me all sorts of questions related to my project), I came to know that my resume was totally in accordance with their requirements. They asked me about my Semantic Web project and my OOAD project (they were trying to pretend as if I did nothing in that OOAD project but when I explained him about what my modules were and how it helped me to understand a big systems (Flipkart), they were persuaded). They asked me a question regarding LOGIN/SIGN UP module of Flipkart. They asked me to design the DB for login/sign up and how exactly was I saving the passwords in my DB to which I replied that I was running an MD5 algorithm (which is the standardized algo for encryption) in my JAVA application before storing them into my DB. So even if a select statement is executed by an intruder, we would get only encrypted password. The question that followed, as expected, was: \"So, what if the user forgets his password?\". I replied, \"Ask him to enter his user email ID and send him a \'Reset Password\' link that will ask him to give and confirm his new password!\" ;). Then I was asked about Semantic Web and how it is useful in data integration in today\'s world. They disclosed it to me that they were to start a new project on the same and that if I get selected, I could expect to be working on a \'similar platform\'. However, whatever they have been doing/will do would be ONLY in .NET. Then, they gave me a puzzle to solve which I couldn\'t but I tried and left it atlast by saying, \"I had seen this puzzle earlier but wasn\'t convinced with the solution. It would be my great pleasure if you may kindly help me to understand its correct solution.\"</p>\r\n<p>**Btws, the puzzle was: \"How many minimum no. of races are required to judge 3 fastest horses out of 35 horses with 5 tracks, such that, only 5 horses can run on these 5 tracks in a race?\"</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>While HP R&amp;D didn\'t really have a focus on the projects, O9 Solutions gave its maximum focus onto projects related to my data modelling project- Semantic Web, my OOAD project on Flipkart and my SE project on RESTful WS. If possible, please do add your github link of your project in your resume, it simply adds professionalism and also convinces them that you have a ready-to-show project with you. This also helps you if you are the one who can explain with full clarity about the work flow of your project. You may explain them by running your project in this case or showing them your piece of code in the project with this github link.</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>1) Be confident in what you speak and adhere to it. If you don\'t know an answer, try it if you can, show them your strategy of solving the problem but PLEASE don\'t beat around the bush as they regard it as time wastage and get a negative feeling about you.</p>\r\n<p>2) Accept the answers/word of advice of the interviewer in case they try guiding you. Don\'t be arrogant and don\'t argue unnecessarily.</p>\r\n<p>3) Be clear of the fact if you\'re interested in a company. This helps in saving your time as well as it gives an opportunity to others who are really interested in that company.</p>\r\n<p>***4) IF YOU HAVE A LOW CGPA (mine was 2.52 at the time of my placement), put your personal details first and your projects on the first page. Many times, the interviewer doesn\'t get to the second page since, he gets busy asking/viewing your first page itself. Then put your \"Fields of Interest and Technical Skills\" followed by \"Achievements\". Put your academic details later in your resume. If they ask, somehow, reach the later part of your resume and view your CGPA and ask you about your low performance, give them a logical reason like, \"I had worked more on my projects in my academic life in IIITB so far as my sole reason for pursuing M.tech was to understand my technical interests which I feel is only possible through practical applications rather than just reading like I did in my B.tech. I feel a 3 figure numeric value is too little to showcase my attained knowledge that I have gained in these 6-\'whatever years you are into engineering field\' years.\" If you have a good CGPA/percentage (I had a decent CGPA, so I said the same), tell them that in B.tech, you were not satisfied even though you had got a good percentage/CGPA at the end and that drove you for pursuing Mtech. :)</p>\r\n<p>5) There are technical nterview blogs like http://javarevisited.blogspot.in/ . Search many more lie these and prepare yourself.</p>\r\n<p>6) Also remember, you can drive your interviewer in asking questions that you want them to ask...That is through what you speak/answer. So, be selective in what you speak. Take your time and then answer.</p>\r\n<p>7) Never lose hope!! I am a guy with a very low CGPA, I got my internship in the 21st company but I got my FTE in 43rd company.... Be cheerful. Don\'t make yourself as unnecessary rivals with others.</p>\r\n<p>Take time out for your leisure activities as well, including hanging out with friends but be systematic as much as you can!</p>\r\n<p>8) Talk to your friends and families in case, you are feeling down about yourself. Take guidance from the professors. Don\'t hesitate in asking them questions.</p>\r\n<p>9) Know about every details of your project. In case, you have difficulties in explaining them. Prepare points on what you wan to say but don\'t mug them up! Catch a friend...Give a presentation of your project to the person...Seek advice from the person to help yourself improve...</p>\r\n<p>10) Don\'t lose your focus on your academic studies for the current semester, especially, if you have a low/average CGPA.</p>\r\n<p>11) Don\'t take too heavy subjects in the third semester, in case you are still left unplaced till the inception of your third semester- My perspective...Definitely, it depends on person to person as per their preferences.</p>\r\n<p>12) Not the least- EAT HEALTHY, BE HEALTHY, SLEEP WELL, DON\'T BURDEN/STRESS YOUSELF! :)</p>\r\n<p>All the Best!!!! :) :) :) :)</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 11:20:19','2017-04-06 11:20:19','Shrimant Chakrabarti','Mtech it','na','NA'),(40,'na','na@iiitb.org',2012,'<p>Name:</p>\r\n<p>Vishesh Jain</p>\r\n<p>Experiences:</p>\r\n<p>Company: inmobi</p>\r\n<p>written:</p>\r\n<p>it was for 80 mins.. 1st section was simple mcq( gate questions ) - 30 ques around...and there was time limit 25 mins...after 25 mins it automatically switches to next section.</p>\r\n<p>2nd section had 1 coding problem-again 25 mins time</p>\r\n<p>3rd section also had a coding problem- 30 mins for this one.</p>\r\n<p>then 1st interview:</p>\r\n<p>started with \"tell me about yourself\"... then he asked me about my current and previous sem subjects... then bit of project.. and 3 coding problems...</p>\r\n<p>a)find the largest palindrome in the string( did it using DP )</p>\r\n<p>b)zig-zag traversal of binary tree( did it using 2 stacks )</p>\r\n<p>c)given an array A[], and a rule array R[], A[] has some numbers...

Then he told me about the work culture and the type of work that i would be doing if selected.</p>\r\n<p>then he asked me about my hobbies an all.</p>\r\n<p>asked me about how were the previous two interviews??</p>\r\n<p>then he gave only a single coding problem(again DP):</p>\r\n<p>given a matrix M[][] and an string str[] (both of char type), need to find if string exist in matrix, and we can move either right or down.</p>\r\n<p>ex:if M[3][3]={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i}</p>\r\n<p>str[4]=\"befi\"</p>\r\n<p>then answer would be \"True\"</p>\r\n<p>it took around 40 mins to solve the ques and write the code.</p>\r\n<p>4th interview(HR):</p>\r\n<p>interviewer: why is this 1 year gap b/w b.tech and m.tech??</p>\r\n<p>me: did prep for GATE.</p>\r\n<p>Inter: didn\'t you get any job in b.tech??</p>\r\n<p>me: i did, but didn\'t joined.</p>\r\n<p>inter: why?</p>\r\n<p>me: wanted to go for product based company as i don\'t like to wear formal.</p>\r\n<p>inter: so, why didn\'t u tried for off-campus?</p>\r\n<p>me: i tried, but my resume was never short-listed, as my b.tech college was not in \'A\' or \'B\' category college. So, i prepared for GATE, and now i am here.</p>\r\n<p>inter: which other companies has already visited??</p>\r\n<p>me: Amazon and Morgan Stanley for intern.</p>\r\n<p>inter: what happened over there??</p>\r\n<p>me: was out in the 1st round of amazon.</p>\r\n<p>inter: why?</p>\r\n<p>me: was not prepared.</p>\r\n<p>inter: and morgan?</p>\r\n<p>me: didn\'t applied.</p>\r\n<p>inter: why?</p>\r\n<p>me: as i am not comfortable in formals.</p>\r\n<p>inter: Great!! So, what do you know about Inmobi?</p>\r\n<p>me: its an Indian mobile advertising company...and... blah blah...</p>\r\n<p>inter: why do you want to join??</p>\r\n<p>me: firstly, no formals to wear, i think type of work you are offering matches my profile, working environment is good, and lastly the package.</p>\r\n<p>inter: how can you say \"work that we are doing matches your profile\"??</p>\r\n<p>me: initially, i thought that its a testing profile, so i asked about the profile in the 2nd interview, so he told me that its not a testing profile rather its a dev profile. And in 3rd interview, he explained me the profile as he is in the same profile. So, i think it matches my profile, as i love algorithms.</p>\r\n<p>inter: you don\'t know java and javascript. How will you manage?</p>\r\n<p>me: i don\'t think language is a barrier. I know logic and OOPs concepts, so i can learn it any day.</p>\r\n<p>inter: any questions??</p>\r\n<p>me: no.</p>\r\n<p>inter: thanks!!</p>\r\n<p>===============================</p>\r\n<p>done with last one...</p>\r\n<p>Got selected !! :) FT and intern-ship both</p>\r\n<p>To what extent, projects, coding competitions, previous workEx are referred?</p>\r\n<p>they mainly focused on dynamic programming (DP)</p>\r\n<p>Any comments or words of guidance if you would like to add for your juniors..</p>\r\n<p>make your algorithms strong(especially, focus on DP)</p>\r\n<p>and before writing the code on system, write the pseudo code on paper and dry-run for different edge cases.</p>\r\n<p>try to think of logic by yourself, try not to refer books or net.</p>\r\n<p>just \"READ THE PROBLEM, THINK HARD, WRITE THE SOLUTION\", it may happen that you take a whole day solving just a single problem, but trust me, you will learn a lot with this type of practice. And this will help you during interviews as you would be knowing that how to formulate the problem.</p>\r\n<p>In most of the interviews, they just look at your approach.</p>',NULL,NULL,'2017-04-06 11:21:27','2017-04-06 11:21:27','Vishesh Jain','Mtech it','na','NA'),(41,'MT2015059','kushbaronj@gmail.com',2016,'<p>Hi all,</p>\r\n<p>The written round is an standard IPAT, which contain 18 Q of number series and 18 Q of probability and statics and each Q has a fixed time of 2.5 min, so i would suggest as soon as the Q comes to you, just select a random option then start solving the Q, bcz the window disappear as soon as the time gets over.</p>\r\n<p>For data analytics profile i have gone through 2 round of interview.</p>\r\n<p>Round 1:- He started with just asking tell me about your self (which was the most difficult Q for me), i would suggest u to prepare that ans very carefully because it matters a lot, in my ans i covered all the project i did in my academics relating them with my interest.</p>\r\n<p>I explained him my project including all the technology that were used in it(for 40min).</p>\r\n<p>Then he asked everything which was there in my resume (prepare your resume very carefully, start writing it today and try to improve it every day, it is your selling point).</p>\r\n<p>Then he asked very basic coding Q.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Round 2: He just asked me about hadoop and spark(i was having just basic knowledge of hadoop), then i just expalained him mapreduce algorithm(but he was not expecting that), then few things about cloud.
